<h2 class="no-brk lsp2">PREFACE.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">The object of this book is expressed in the title. It is
intended to be a useful book for school teaching, and
advances no higher pretensions. Some years ago, at a
meeting of Public School Masters, the want of such a book
was spoken of, and at the suggestion of his friends, the
Author determined to attempt to supply this want. The
objections raised to the school histories ordinarily used
were&mdash;first, the absence of historical perspective, produced
by the unconnected manner in which the facts were narrated,
and the inadequate mention of the foreign relations
of the country; secondly, the omission of many important
points of constitutional history; thirdly, the limitation of
the history to the political relations of the nation, to the
exclusion of its social growth. It was at first intended to
approach the history almost entirely on the social and
constitutional side; but a very short trial proved that this
method required a too constant employment of allusions,
and presupposed too much knowledge in the reader, to be
suitable for a book intended primarily for schools. It was
therefore resolved to limit the description of the growth of
society to a few comprehensive chapters and passages, and
to follow the general course of history in such a way as
to bring out as clearly as possible the connection of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
events, and their relative importance in the general national
growth. This decision, though taken against his inclinations,
the Author can no longer regret, as the social side of
our history has been so adequately treated by Mr. Green
in his <em>History of the English People</em>, of the approaching
publication of which he was at the time quite ignorant.
On the same grounds of practical utility, it has been
thought better to retain the old and well-known divisions
into reigns, rather than to disturb the knowledge boys
have already gained by the introduction of a new though
more scientific division.</p>

<p>The Author has not scrupled to avail himself of the
works of modern authors, though, in most cases, he has verified
their views by reference to original authorities. In the
earlier period the works of Professor <span class="smcap">Stubbs</span>, Mr. <span class="smcap">Freeman</span>,
and Dr. <span class="smcap">Pauli</span>; in the Tudor and Stuart period those of
<span class="smcap">Froude</span>, <span class="smcap">Ranke</span>, and <span class="smcap">Macaulay</span>; in the later period the histories
of Miss <span class="smcap">Martineau</span> and Lord <span class="smcap">Stanhope</span> have been of
the greatest assistance. Greater stress has been laid upon
the later than the earlier periods, as is indeed obvious from
the divisions of the work. With regard to the starting-point
chosen, it may be well to explain that the English invasion
was fixed upon, because it so thoroughly obliterated all
remnants of the Roman rule, that they have exerted little
or no influence upon the development of the nation&mdash;the
real point of interest in a national history. It is hoped
that the genealogies of the great families will assist in the
comprehension of mediæval times in the history of which
they played so large a part, and that the maps supplied
will suffice to enable the reader to follow pretty accurately,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
without reference to another atlas, the military and political
events mentioned. A brief and rapid summary for the
use of beginners was originally projected to preface the
work, but the brevity required by a book of this description
rendered such an addition impossible without injury
to the more important part. An attempt has been made to
replace it by a very full analysis, which, in the hands of
a careful teacher, has been proved by experience a useful
method of teaching the main facts of history.</p>

<h2 class="no-brk">INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">The history of civilization can be traced in great lines which
have more or less followed a similar direction throughout
all Europe. The interest of a national history is to observe the
course which these lines have followed in a particular instance;
for, examined in detail, their course has never been identical.
The period occupied by what we speak of as English history
is that, speaking broadly, during which the great mediæval systems&mdash;feudalism
and the Church&mdash;have by degrees given place
to modern society, of which the moving-springs are freedom of
the individual, government in accordance with the popular will,
and freedom of thought. The object of a History of England is
therefore to trace that change as it worked itself out amid all the
various influences which affected it in our own nation. The peculiar
circumstances of the Norman conquest prevented the complete
development in England of either of the great Continental systems.
Neither the feudal system nor the system of the Roman Church are
to be found in their completeness in England. The separation of
England from the Empire, the entire destruction of the Roman occupation
by the German invaders, prevented that contact between German
and Roman civilization from which Continental feudalism sprang.
And though, if left to itself, the civilization of the early English
would have ripened into some form of feudalism, it was caught by
the Conquest before the process was completed. The Normans
brought with them, indeed, the external apparatus of the completed
system; but in the hands of their great leader, and grafted upon the
existing institutions of the country, it assumed a new form. The
power of the King was always maintained and the power of the
barons suppressed, while room was left under the shadow of a strong
monarchy for the growth of the lower classes of the nation. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span>
same way, the Church was always kept from assuming a position of
supremacy, and its subordinate relations to the State maintained.
The establishment of this new form of government may be held
to occupy the first period of our history since the Conquest, lasting
till the reign of John. During that time the barons, who had more
than once attempted to establish the same virtual independence as
was enjoyed by their fellows abroad, were taught to recognize the
power of the Crown. The legislation of Henry I. and Henry II.,
and the establishment under the latter of a new nobility dependent
for their status upon their ministerial services, coupled with the incorporation
of the national system of justice with the feudal system
of the conquerors, united all classes of Englishmen and consolidated
the nation, but in so doing raised to an alarming degree the power of
the Crown. The miserable reign of John, and the tyrannical use he
made of the power thus placed in his hands, called attention to the
dangers which beset the administrative arrangements of his father.
The total severance of England from France, which took place in his
reign, and his rash quarrel with the Church, completed the work of
national consolidation, but placed the united nation in antagonism to
the throne. The nobility, which in other countries were the natural
enemies of all classes below them, were thus forced to assume the lead
of all who desired a reasonable amount of national freedom.</p>

<p>The struggle to harmonize the relations which should exist between
the Crown and the subject occupies the second period of our history.
It assumes several forms; sometimes the dislike of foreigners, sometimes
a desire for self-taxation, sometimes it seems little more than an
outbreak of an over-strong nobility. But whatever its form, the
fruits of the struggle were lasting. The rival claims of King and
nation, acknowledged and regulated by the wisdom of Edward I.,
gave rise to that balanced constitution which in its latest development
still exists among us. But it would seem that this great
advance in government had been somewhat premature. In other
nations institutions resembling our Parliament sprang into existence,
and faded away before the power of the Crown, an effect which can
be traced chiefly to the strong line of division separating the commonalty
from the nobles. Without support from the nobility,
and in all its interests in direct antagonism to it, the commonalty,
after supporting the Crown in the destruction of the baronage,
found itself in presence of a power to which it was unable to offer
any resistance. Several causes already mentioned had in England
weakened the sharp definition of classes, but there was a great risk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span>
even there of a similar failure of constitutional monarchy. It was as
the leader of the nobility that Henry IV. first rose into importance
in the reign of Richard II., and subsequently obtained the crown.
The limitation of the franchise in the reign of Henry VI., and the
consequent subserviency of Parliament, were steps towards the elevation
of an aristocratical influence, which, had it grown till its suppression
by the Crown was rendered necessary, would have reproduced
in England the historical phenomena visible in France. Fortunately
the nobility were not at one among themselves. The various sources
from which they derived their origin, the close family connections,
and personal interests, split them into factions, which, taking advantage
of a disputed succession, brought their quarrel to the trial of the
sword with such animosity that the nobility of England was virtually
extinguished.</p>

<p>But while this faction fight, and the great French war which
preceded it, attract the attention chiefly during the third period
of the history, a quiet advance of great importance had been going
on, sheltered by the more obvious movements of the time. The
same spirit which had found its expression in the establishment
of the Constitution, had indirectly, if not directly, influenced every
class of the nation. The exclusive merchant guild had given place
to the craftsman’s guild. The wars in France, the alienation of
property fostered by the legislation of Edward I., the Black Death,
which had robbed the country of at least a third of its labouring
hands, had sealed the fate of serfdom, and established in England
the great class of free wage labourers. The same alienation, the
gradual increase and importance of trade, and the formation and
introduction of capital, had formed a middle class of gentry, from
which the successful merchant was not excluded. Nor had this
political growth been unaccompanied by an advance of thought.
The failure of the crusades, the last great exhibition of material
religion; the Franciscan revival; the philosophy of Bacon and his
successors; the bold declaration of independence on the part of
Wicliffe, and the grasping and repellent character of the Roman
Court, had shaken the Church to its foundations. The storm which
had shaken the surface of English society had left its depths unmoved
and undisturbed by the great work of extermination proceeding
overhead; these processes of growth had been gradually
continuing their course during the whole of the third period. Thus,
then, when Edward IV. emerged from the troubles of the Wars
of the Roses as King of England, his position, though it might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span>
seem very similar to that of a king who had triumphed over his
nobility, was yet considerably modified. The nobility were no
doubt gone, but it was not the Crown which had crushed them.
The Church, indeed, threw all its influence on the side of the
Crown, but it was in the consciousness of the insecurity of its position
in the hearts of the people that it did so. The King and his
Commons stood face to face, with no intermediate class to check
their mutual action, but the Commons were already free, and headed
by a rapidly rising body of wealthy secondary landowners or
merchants. Nevertheless, the immediate effect of the destruction
of the nobility was completely to check constitutional growth, and
to establish a government which was little short of arbitrary.</p>

<p>The Italian statecraft, which the influence of the Renaissance
rendered paramount, for the moment increased the tendency to
absolutism; and in the reign of Henry VIII., though a shadow of
popular government yet remained, the will of the king was little
short of absolute. What may be called the fourth period of our
history is occupied by the establishment of this arbitrary power, and
the gradual awakening of national life, under the influences of the
Renaissance, and of the circumstances which accompanied the Reformation,
which tended to modify it in the reign of Elizabeth. When
Protestantism and the vigorous young thought of the reawakened
nation became linked indissolubly with the fortunes of the
sovereign in her national war against Spain, the mere necessity
of the union tended much to put a practical limit to <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'the arbitrary of'">the arbitrary</ins>
character of the new monarchy. It was the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'miscomprehension the'">miscomprehension of
the</ins> necessity of this union between king and people which produced
the contests which occupy our history during the reign of the
Stuarts.</p>

<p>Bred in the theory of monarchy by Divine right, the logical
offspring of feudalism, when separated from the Empire and the
Church, the Stuarts were willing to accept the arbitrary power of
their predecessors, but would not acknowledge the necessity of
harmonious action with the people, on which alone, as things then
were, such arbitrary authority could rest. The middle class of
gentry had been increasing in power and influence till they were
now in a position to assume that leadership in the nation which the
destruction of the nobles had left vacant. And behind them there
was the bulk of the people, whose Protestantism, the religious
character of the late national struggle, and the love of truth
engendered by the Renaissance, had raised to enthusiastic Puritanism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[xxxix]</a></span>
The constitutional life, checked for a time by the Tudor monarchy,
again sprang into existence. In the struggle which ensued it was
the enthusiastic party which ultimately triumphed, and its leader,
Cromwell, is seen mingling his conscientious efforts at the establishment
of constitutional government with a religious fervour too great
to be sustained.</p>

<p>But his rule, freed from those parts for which, as yet, the gentry
at all events were unprepared, established, definitely and for ever,
the necessity of recurring sooner or later to the constitutional principles
of the fourteenth century. In the Revolution of 1688 those
principles triumphed. But they triumphed in the hands no longer
of a great enthusiastic leader, but of a party, which found its chief
supporters in a limited number of noble houses, whose aristocratic
pride was injured by the arbitrary power of the sovereign, and whose
influence in the formation of Parliament promised them political
superiority under the establishment of parliamentary government.
From that time till the present the scene of the contest has been
changed. A party struggle of some thirty years gave place to the
unchecked predominance of parliamentary rule. And the last
period of our history has been occupied by the efforts of the excluded
nation to make their voice heard above that of a nominal representation,
consisting in reality of the representatives of a dominant class,
under the influence either of the great Whig families or of the
Crown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Departure of the
Romans.</div>

<p class="drop-cap">The dominion of the Romans in Britain had been complete.
The country, as far as the Frith of Forth, had been brought
under Roman civilization. But in England, as elsewhere, the continuance
of that form of civilization had produced
weakness; and the unconquered Britons of the North,
known by the name of Picts, broke into the Romanized districts, and
pushed their incursions far into the centre of the country. On all
sides, the nations outside the Empire were breaking through its
limits and threatening its existence. The danger which threatened
the very heart of the Empire, from the advance of the Goths into
Italy, compelled the Romans in 411 to withdraw their legions from
Britain, and leave the inhabitants of the island to fight their own
battles with the Picts. When these enemies formed an alliance with
the pirates of Ireland, known by the name of the Scots, and with the
German pirates of the North Sea, known as English or Saxons,
the civilized Britons were unable to make head against them, and
found it necessary to seek for aid among the invaders themselves
They therefore made an arrangement with two Jutish chiefs or
Ealdormen, Hengist and Horsa, to come to their assistance. The
German rovers consisted of three nations&mdash;the Saxons, the inhabitants
of Holstein, who had advanced along the coast of Friesland;
to the north of them the Angles or English, who inhabited Sleswig;
and still further to the north, the Jutes, whose name is still perpetuated
in the promontory of Jutland.</p>

<div class="sn-box">

<div class="sidenotex">The Saxons in

<div class="sidenotex">The Angles in
East Anglia.

</div>

<p>The first landing-place of the Jutish allies of the Britons was in
the Isle of Thanet, separated at that time by a considerable
inlet from the British mainland. Their aid
enabled the Britons to drive back the Pictish invaders.
But their success, and the settlement they had formed, enticed many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
of their brethren to join them, and their numbers were constantly
increasing. Increase of numbers implied increased demand in the
way of payment and provisions. Quarrels arose between the new-comers
and their British allies. War was determined on. The inlet
which divided Thanet from the mainland was passed, and at
Aylesford, on the Medway, a battle was fought, which, though it
cost Horsa his life, put the conquering Barbarians into possession of
much of the east of Kent. The victory was followed by the extermination
of the inhabitants; against the clergy especially the anger
of the conquerors was directed. The country was thus cleared of the
inhabitants, and the new-comers settled down, bringing with them
their goods and families and national institutions. This process was
repeated at every stage of the conquest of the country, which thus
became not only a conquest but a re-settlement. The Jutish
conquest of Kent was followed, in 477, by an invasion of the Saxons,
who, under Ella, overran the south of Sussex, and
captured the fortress of Anderida near Pevensey; and
in 495, by a fresh Saxon invasion under Cerdic and
Cymric, who passed up the Southampton water and established
the kingdom of the West Saxons. A momentary check was given
to the advance of the conquerors, in 520, at the battle of Mount
Badon. But almost immediately fresh hordes of Angles began
conquering and settling the East of England, where they established
the East Anglian kingdom, with its two great
divisions of Northfolk and Southfolk. Between that
time and 577, the date of a victory at Deorham, in
Gloucestershire, the West Saxons had overrun what are now Hampshire
and Wiltshire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire, and the valley of the
Severn, reaching almost as far as Chester; while the Angles, entering
the Humber and working up the rivers, established themselves on the
Trent, where they were known as Mercians or Border men, and formed
two Northern kingdoms, that of Deira in Yorkshire, and that of
Bernicia, extending as far as the Forth. The capital of this last-named
kingdom was Bamborough, founded by Ida, and called after
his wife Bebba, Bebbanburgh, or Bamborough.</p>

<p>The junction of these two kingdoms under Æthelfrith, about
600, established the Kingdom of Northumbria; thus was begun
the process of consolidating the several divided English kingdoms.
This tendency to consolidation is marked by the title of Bretwalda,
which is given to the chief of the nation dominant for the time
being. The name had been applied to Ella of Sussex, to Ceawlin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
of Wessex, and was held at the time of the establishment of the
Northumbrian power by Æthelberht of Kent. There were thus
two pre-eminent powers among the English&mdash;Northumbria, under its
king Æthelfrith, claiming supremacy over the middle districts of
England, including the Mercians and Middle English; and Kent,
under Æthelberht, paramount over Middlesex, Essex, and East
Anglia; while a third kingdom, that of Wessex, though large in
extent and destined to become the dominant power, was as yet
occupied chiefly in improving its position towards the west. Beyond
these lay the district still in the possession of the Britons. The
possessions of this people were now divided by the conquest of the
English into three&mdash;West Wales, or Cornwall; North Wales, which
we now call Wales; and Strathclyde, a district stretching from the
Clyde along the west of the Pennine chain, and separated from
Wales by Chester, in the hands of the Mercians, and a piece of
Lancashire in the hands of the Northumbrians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conversion of
the English.
597.</div>

<p>It was while the kingdoms of Northumbria and Kent were thus
in the balance that the conversion of the English to the
Christian faith began. Æthelberht of Kent had married
Bercta, the daughter of the Frankish King of Paris.
She was a Christian; and Gregory the Great at that time occupying
the Roman See, which was rapidly rising to the position of supremacy
in the Christian Church, took advantage of the opening thus afforded,
and despatched a band of missionaries under a monk named Augustine
to convert the people. In 597 they landed in Thanet. By the
influence of the Queen they were well received, and established themselves
at Canterbury, which has ever since retained its position as the
seat of the Primacy. The Kings of Essex and East Anglia followed
the example of their superior Lord, and became Christians. The
Northern kingdom was still heathen. But Eadwine, who succeeded
Æthelfrith on the Northumbrian throne, surpassed his predecessor in
power. On Æthelberht’s death, he received the submission of the
East Anglians and men of Essex, and conquered even the West
Saxons. Kent alone remained independent, but was compelled to
purchase security by a close alliance with Eadwine, who married a
Kentish princess. With her went a priest, Paulinus; and priest and
Queen together succeeded in converting Eadwine, and bringing the
Northern kingdom to Christianity. Heathenism was however not
extinct. It found a champion, Penda, King of the Mercians. In
alliance with the Welsh king he attacked and defeated Eadwine, in
633, at the battle of Heathfield, and united under his power those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
who were properly called Mercians and the other English tribes south
of the Humber. He also conquered the West Saxon districts along
the Severn, and thus established what is generally known as the
Kingdom of Mercia. Paulinus had fled from York after the battle
of Heathfield. But the contest between heathen and Christian was
renewed by Oswald, Eadwine’s successor; for Paulinus’ place was
taken by Bishop Aidan, a missionary from Columba’s Irish monastery
in Iona, who had established an Episcopal See in the Island of Lindisfarne.
From thence missionaries issued, who continued the work of
conversion, to which Oswald chiefly devoted his life. Birinus, sent
from Rome, with the support of Oswald, succeeded in converting
even Wessex, and establishing a Christian church at Dorchester.
Penda still continued in the centre of England to uphold the cause
of heathendom. At the battle of Maserfield he conquered and slew
Oswald, and re-established his religion for a time in Wessex. But at
length, in 655, he succumbed to Oswi, Oswald’s successor, and with
him fell the power of heathendom. It seemed as though Irish
Christianity, and not Roman, would thus be the religion of England.
But Rome did not suffer her conquests to slip from her hand. A
struggle arose between the adherents of the two Churches. The
matter was brought to an issue in 664 at a Council at Whitby. The
Roman Church there proved predominant. And this victory was
followed by the appointment of Theodore of Tarsus, an Eastern
divine, to the See of Canterbury. Under him the English
Church was organized. Fresh sees were added to the old ones, which
had usually followed the limits of the old English kingdoms.
Canterbury was established as the centre of Church authority.
Theodore’s ecclesiastical work tended much both to the growth of
national unity and to the close connection of Church and State which
existed during the Saxon period. The unity of the people was expressed
in the single archiepiscopal See of Canterbury and in the
Synods; while the arrangement of bishoprics and parishes according
to existing territorial divisions connected them closely with the
State.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Supremacy of
Mercia.
716-819.</div>

<p>The contest for supremacy between Mercia and Northumbria still
continued. After the fall of Penda, the supremacy of the Northern
kingdom was for some time unquestioned. But sixty years later,
during the reign of three Christian kings, Ethelbald,
Offa, and Cenwulf (716-819), Mercia again rose to great
power. Offa indeed came nearer to consolidating an
empire than any of the preceding kings, although he is not mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
among the Bretwaldas. It is said that he corresponded on
terms of something like equality with Charlemagne; and the great
dyke between the Severn and the Wye which bears his name is
supposed to mark the limits of his conquests over the Britons.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Ecgberht.
800-836.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Consolidation
under the West
Saxons.</div>
</div>

<p>With these princes the supremacy of Mercia closed, for a great
king had in the year 800 ascended the throne of Wessex.
Ecgberht had lived as an exile in his youth at the court
of Charlemagne, and there probably imbibed imperial notions.
During his reign of thirty-six years he gradually brought under his
power all the kingdoms of the English, whether Anglian or Saxon.
In 823, at the great battle of Ellandune, he defeated the Mercians so
completely that their subject kingdoms passed into his power. Four
years later Mercia owned his overlordship, and Northumbria immediately
after yielded without a struggle. These great kingdoms
retained their own line of sovereigns as subordinate kings. Ecgberht
continued the hereditary struggle against the British
populations, with the West Welsh or Cornish, and the
North Welsh or Welsh, and in each instance succeeded
in establishing his supremacy over them. North of the Dee, however,
his power over the British population did not spread. Thus
the kingdom of the West Saxons absorbed all its rivals, and established
a permanent superiority in England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Period of Danish
invasion.
790-1013.</div>

<p>Already, however, a new enemy, before which the rising kingdom
was finally to succumb, had made its appearance; a year before his
death, Ecgberht was called upon to defend his country
from the Danes. This people, issuing from the Scandinavian
kingdoms in the North of Europe, had begun
to land in England, to harry the country, and to carry off their spoil.
At first as robbers, then as settlers, and finally as conquerors, for two
centuries they occupy English history. Their first appearance in
this reign was at Charmouth in Dorsetshire. Subsequently, in
junction with the British, they advanced westward from Cornwall.
This led to the great battle of Hengestesdun, or Hengston, where
the invaders were defeated (835). It seems not unnatural to trace
the appearance of the Northern rovers in England to the state of the
Continent. Driven from their own country by want of room,
obliged to seek new settlements, they found themselves checked by
the organized power of Charlemagne’s empire. They were thus
compelled to find their new home in countries they had not yet
visited. The reign closed with the capture of Chester, the capital of
Gwynedd, the British kingdom of North Wales.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Æthelwulf.
836-857.</div>

<p>The reign of Æthelwulf, the successor of Ecgberht, was chiefly
occupied in constant war with the Danes. Various
success attended his efforts. The great battle at Ockley
(851), where they were heavily defeated, for a time kept them in
check; but, on the whole, the invaders constantly gained ground,
and at last, in 855, for the first time so far changed their predatory
habits as to winter in the Isle of Thanet. Another characteristic
of Æthelwulf’s reign is the connection with Rome which he established.
When his youngest son Alfred was still a child, he sent
him to Rome, where the young prince was anointed; and two years
afterwards he himself took the same journey, was received on the
road by Charles the Bald, King of France, and spent a whole year
in Italy. He there re-established the Saxon College, and by his
engagement to supply funds for its support seems to have originated
the well-known Peter’s Pence. His connection with Charles the
Bald was further cemented by his marriage with Judith, daughter
of that king. After Æthelwulf’s death she married her stepson
Æthelbald, was divorced by him, returned to France, married
Baldwin of Flanders, and was the ancestress of Matilda, wife of
William the Conqueror. These connections show the rising importance
of England, and the entrance of the country into the general
politics of Europe. Something in Æthelwulf’s government, perhaps
his lengthened absence abroad, or the step he had taken in getting
Alfred anointed, excited discontent. His eldest surviving son,
Æthelbald, conspired with other nobles to exclude him from the
country, and he was forced to consent to a compromise, accepting as
his own kingdom, Kent and the Eastern dependencies of Wessex,
while his son ruled over the rest of the kingdom.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Æthelbald.
858-860.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Æthelberht.
860-866.</div>
</div>

<p>On his death he bequeathed his own dominions to Æthelberht,
his second son, while Wessex was, upon the death of
Æthelbald, to pass in succession to his two sons, Æthelred
and Alfred. In spite of this will, on the death of Æthelbald
five years later, Æthelberht of Kent succeeded in
making good his claims to Wessex also, and upon
Æthelberht’s death, after a reign of five years, marked only by
renewed attacks of the Danes, both kingdoms passed without question
to Æthelred.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Æthelred.
866-871.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Danish conquest
of East Anglia.
870.</div>
</div>

<p>It was during the reign of Æthelred that the Danes first established
themselves permanently in the country. In 867
Ingvar and Hubba, said to be the sons of Ragner Lodbrog,
a great Scandinavian hero, invaded England. Legend says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
that this invasion was intended to exact vengeance for the death of
their father, who had been cruelly put to death by Ella of Northumberland.
There are chronological difficulties in the way of accepting
this story, which are increased by the fact that the Danish
landing was really in East Anglia. Thence, in 867, they advanced
into Northumbria and took York. The anarchy in which Northumbria
lay, caused by the rival claims of Osberht and Ella to the
throne, rendered its conquest easy. In 868, they marched towards
Mercia, and took Nottingham. Burhred, the King of Mercia, then
implored the aid of Æthelred and his brother Alfred, who so far
succeeded that they drove the Danes back to Northumbria. From
thence, in 870, an invasion, under many leaders, whose connection is
not very clear, was directed against East Anglia. They were there
joined by Guthrum, another Danish leader, and their combined
forces pressed victoriously onwards through Croyland, to Peterborough,
Huntingdon, and Ely. After defeating the English at
Thetford, they took Edmund, the Saxon King of East Anglia,
prisoner, and, upon his refusal to accept the pagan
religion, put him to death. For his constancy he was
honoured with the title of Saint Edmund. East Anglia
was thus completely in possession of the Danes, and Guthrum took
to himself the title of king. East Anglia became henceforward for
some time the principal point of Danish settlement in England.
From thence the invaders passed into Wessex, under the command of
Bagsecg and Halfdene. They were vigorously met by Æthelred.
They pushed on, however, as far up the Thames as Reading, near
which town a series of battles was fought,&mdash;at Englefield, where the
Danes were beaten; at Reading, where the fortune of the day was
changed; and subsequently at the great battle of Ashdown, where
the victory of the English was regarded as being due to Alfred, who,
being in command of half the army, attacked and defeated the
enemy, while his brother was losing the precious moments in prayer
for success. Though the victory of Ashdown was complete, it did not
close the war. Almost immediately afterwards we hear of battles at
Basing and at Merton, in which the Danes were again successful.
These battles took place just before the death of Æthelred.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Alfred.
871-901.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Treaty of
Wedmore.</div>
</div>

<p>He was succeeded at once by his brother Alfred. Another victory
of the Danes at Wilton compelled Alfred to make peace.
For a time the Danes withdrew from Wessex, and
employed their energy in subjugating Mercia. Burhred, who had
married Alfred’s sister, was driven from the throne, and retired to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Rome to die. A Danish agent, named Ceolwulf, was put in his
place, and the country laid under heavy contribution. But Ceolwulf
in his turn was displaced, and the Danes took possession of much of
the country themselves, conquering among other places the five great
towns, Lincoln, Nottingham, Derby, Leicester, and Stamford, known
as the five Danish Burghs, or, with the addition of York and
Chester, the seven Burghs. They also carried their invasions northward,
and Cumberland and part of Strathclyde were overrun and
peopled by them, under the command of Halfdene. Nor was the
treaty with the East Anglian Danes permanent. Guthrum sailed
round the coast and captured Wareham and Exeter. To oppose
them on their own element, Alfred introduced a new form of ship,
of greater size and length than had hitherto been used, and succeeded
in winning a great naval victory in Swanage Bay. But the Danish
forces were gradually closing round him. London and Essex had
been taken, and a colony of Danes had conquered South Wales. At
length, attacked in all directions, his kingdom of Wessex was practically
limited to the country of the Somersœtas; and, unable to
make head against his enemies, the King took refuge among the
impassable morasses of the river Parret. It is during this time of his
exile that the well-known story of the burnt cakes is told. But
while apparently completely beaten, Alfred succeeded in gathering
a new army, issued from his seclusion, and attacking the Danes at
Edington (878), near Westbury, completely defeated them. The consequence
of this battle was the Treaty of Wedmore. By
this treaty the kingdom of East Anglia was surrendered to
the Danes, and a line was drawn to separate their kingdom from that
of Wessex. This line from the Thames ran along the Lea to Bedford,
then along the Ouse till it struck Watling Street, and then followed
Watling Street to the Welsh Border. The greater part of Mercia was
thus restored to Wessex. In exchange, Anglia and Mercia beyond
this line were ceded to the Danes, who were to hold them as vassals
of the West Saxon king, and who were to become Christians. The
limits of their occupation are still to be traced by the occurrence of
the termination “by” in the names of the towns; it was in many
instances appended to the name of the Danish holder of the manor.
Guthrum, on his baptism, took the name of Æthelstan, and many
difficulties in the chronology of the legends of the time may be
solved by supposing that the Æthelstan mentioned in them is
Guthrum, and not the Æthelstan who reigned in the year 925.
This treaty, although it curtailed the supremacy of Wessex, made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the kingdom in fact stronger, and secured a temporary rest for the
whole of England. Mercia, that part of it at least which remained
English, was governed by its Alderman Æthelred, and by the King’s
daughter Æthelflæd, known as the Lady of the Mercians. On the
death of Gutred, the Danish King of Northumbria, Alfred re-established
his power there, and the peace and prosperity of England were
further increased by the fact that the energy of the Danes was for the
present chiefly directed against France and Belgium. Guthrum died
in 890, and though the treaty was confirmed by his successors, the
defeat of the Danes in Belgium threw fresh invaders into the kingdom.
In 893, Hasting, a well-known sea-rover, in alliance with the
Anglians and Northumbrians, committed fresh ravages in all directions;
but at last, having ventured up the Lea, Alfred hit upon the
expedient of draining the river, and leaving their ships aground.
After this they were glad to retreat, but lesser expeditions were constantly
vexing the coast. The reign of Alfred is thus divided into
two periods of Danish war, between which, and at the close of his
life, there occurred intervals of peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Appreciation of
Alfred’s character.</div>

<p>It has been usual to attribute to Alfred most of the marked peculiarities
of English civilization, the formation of shires,
the establishment of juries, and so on. Such assertions
will not bear examination. As a lawgiver, he collected
the laws of the three principal states over which he ruled&mdash;Kent,
Mercia, and Wessex&mdash;which had been already recorded by the Kings
Æthelberht, Offa, and Ine. As a warrior he was on the whole
victorious, and understood the necessity of establishing a fleet, which
he appears to have constructed on a different principle from that of
the Danes, the ships being longer, and serving less as mere stages on
which to fight. As a governor he was impartial and strict; his
police was severe, the system of mutual responsibility became universal,
and under him the idea of morality began to mingle with the
idea of injury to the commonwealth, which had been the Saxon
notion of crime. His son Eadward, who succeeded him, was probably
as great as his father, but he had not the love of literature
which forms the marked characteristic of Alfred’s public life. It has
been questioned whether Alfred could himself read; however this may
have been, he was so conscious of the necessity of literature for the
people that he set himself to work to make translations for them.
“The History of the World on Christian Principles,” by Orosius,
Bede’s “History of the Anglo-Saxon Church,” and Boethius’ “Consolation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of Philosophy,” were the works he translated. Besides his
own literary work, he established conventual schools at Shaftesbury and
Athelney, and probably a more general one at Oxford. The love of
the people, whom his indefatigable energy saved from their barbarous
and pagan invaders, has attributed to their hero an original genius
of which there are no distinct proofs. What is really known of him
is, that he was an able, honest, persevering governor, gifted with that
power and habit of method and organization which is perhaps more
useful in advancing early civilization than greater and more splendid
gifts. Upon Alfred’s death, though England, as a whole, had suffered
by the loss of the country granted to the Danes,
or, as it was called, the Danelagu, Wessex had assumed
a position of superiority, and was regarded as the representative state
of the English. This position it fully vindicated during the reigns
of Eadward, Alfred’s son, who succeeded him, and of the four next
kings, till the kingdom of Wessex grew to be the kingdom of England,
and exerted an imperial supremacy over the whole island.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Eadward the
Elder.
901-925.</div>
</div>

<p>Eadward’s first difficulty was with his cousin Æthelwulf, the son
of Alfred’s elder brother Æthelred. This prince claimed
the throne. He landed in England, was driven to Northumbria,
where he was chosen king, and then, in company
with Eohric, the King of East Anglia, marched up the Thames
to Cricklade. He was however defeated, and with his ally killed by
a portion of the English army near the Ouse. The consequence was
the renewal of the acknowledgment of the supremacy of Wessex by
Guthrum II. of East Anglia. In conjunction with his sister, the
Lady of the Mercians, Eadward attempted to secure himself from
further molestation by the erection of numerous stone castles. These
castles, which seem to have been built on a new and better plan than
any before erected, became also in many instances the origin from
which towns sprang; for laws were passed creating them into
markets, and forbidding bargains to be made without the walls.
Some sort of monopoly of trade was thus secured for fortified posts.
On the death of Æthelflæd, Mercia, both Anglian and Danish,
submitted to Eadward’s authority. He continued the active government
of his sister, and went on with her work of fortress-building.
An invasion by the Danes of Northumbria in conjunction with the
Welsh, who hoped to find Mercia unguarded, was signally defeated.
The Welsh kings swore alliance to Eadward, and the Danes of
Northumbria, and even the Kings of Scotland and Strathclyde,
acknowledged him as their “father and lord.” Eadward was thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
in fact master of the whole of England, and had completed more
thoroughly the work of Ecgberht. The greatness of his position is
clearly marked by the marriages of his children with the greatest
Princes of the Continent. One married Charles the Simple of
France, a second Hugh the Great, Count of Paris, a third Otto I.,
Emperor of Germany.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Battle of

</div>

<p>The greatness Eadward had thus secured descended to his son
Æthelstan, with whom the grandeur of the Saxon monarchy
reached its highest point. He married one of his
sisters to a Northumbrian prince, Cytric, receiving his allegiance for
Benicia from the Tees to Edinburgh, and, on the death of Cytric,
incorporated the country with his own dominions. Cytric’s two sons
fled, the one to Ireland, where the Danes received him willingly,
the other (Guthrith) to Constantine, King of Scotland. The consequence
of the escape of these princes became evident in after years.
In 934, Constantine and his heir Eorca, Owen or Eugenius, King
of Cumberland, made war upon England, but were defeated and
compelled to acknowledge the supremacy of Æthelstan. The
attention of the English King was subsequently drawn abroad,
where he upheld the cause of his nephew, Louis de Outre-Mer, son
of Charles the Simple, against the attacks of his brothers-in-law, the
German Otto and Hugh of Paris. It was while thus employed that
the Scotch kingdoms again rose in insurrection. A great conspiracy
against Æthelstan appears to have been formed, at the head of which
were Anlath, son of that Guthrith who had fled to Scotland,
Constantine, Owen, and several princes of the Danes from Ireland.
Their object was the re-establishment of the Danish power in
Northumbria. The attempt was completely thwarted by the great
battle of Brunanburh, near Beverley, in Yorkshire.
Not long after this decisive victory Æthelstan died.
His splendid reign is further marked by legislation of a
more original description than that of his predecessors. He ordered,
among other things, that every man should have a lord who should be
answerable for him to justice, and rendered more systematic the
arrangement of mutual responsibility, which appears to have been
one of the principles of Saxon police.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Eadmund.

<div class="sidenotex">Eadred.

</div>

<p>His younger brothers, Eadmund and Eadred, followed in his
footsteps, defeating the Northumbrian rebels, who from
time to time elected kings of their own, but were
completely conquered by Eadred. He so thoroughly
incorporated the country with his own, that its ruler could no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
longer claim the title of king. Both Bernicia and Deira were bestowed
as an earldom on Osulf, who had assisted in the conquest
of the rebels, and remained in the hands of his family till the Norman
Conquest. Eadmund also maintained his supremacy over Scotland,
with which country his relations were of a very friendly nature,
as he granted a part of the kingdom of Strathclyde, consisting of
Cumberland and Galloway, to King Malcolm, to be held by military
service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rise of Dunstan.</div>

<p>The policy of Eadred and of his successors seems so closely connected
with the rise of Dunstan, that it may be justly attributed
to him. The monkish historians, to whom we owe
our knowledge of this great man, have overlaid his history with mythical
stories, and have given him a character and policy to suit their
own purposes. In their eagerness to secure the name of the greatest
statesman of the age in support of their pretensions against the
secular clergy, they have drawn him as a youth of miraculous gifts,
of severe monkish asceticism, whose claim to greatness consisted in the
establishment of the Benedictine rule. In the same way they have
painted his opponent King Edwy [Eadwig] in the blackest colours.
The common story tells us that, after a childhood passed in learning,
so deep as to excite a suspicion of magic, illness drove Dunstan to the
cloister at Glastonbury; that he there established the Benedictine
rule, entering with such vehemence into its spirit that his asceticism
almost turned his brain. On the accession of Edwy, the young king,
it is said, deserted the assembly of the nobles, to pass his time in the
company of the beautiful Ælfgyfu [Elgiva], his mistress. Dunstan
is represented as violently dragging the unworthy king back to his
proper place, as securing the banishment of Ælfgyfu, and with his
partisans cruelly putting her to death upon her return. Edwy is
then described as raging fiercely against all the monks in his
kingdom. In truth, it is in politics rather than in ecclesiastical
discipline that Dunstan’s greatness must be sought, and he must
take his place in history rather as a conciliatory and patriotic
governor than as an ascetic and violent churchman.</p>

<p>Born at the beginning of King Æthelstan’s reign, and trained
partly at Glastonbury, where he found and studied books left by
wandering Irish scholars, and partly at the King’s Court like other
young nobles of the time, an illness induced him to devote himself to
the Church. His interest secured him the Abbey of Glastonbury at
the early age of seventeen. He shortly returned to the Court, became
the King’s treasurer, and as an influential minister joined himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to the party which he found pre-eminent during the reign of
Eadred. That king was a constant invalid, the influence of the
Queen Mother was paramount, and she was supported by the chiefs
of East Anglia and those whose views were national rather than provincial.
The kingdom of Northumbria was in a state of ceaseless
confusion. Again and again the Danes and Ostmen raised insurrections
there. Wulstan, the Archbishop of York, with constantly
shifting policy, at one time supported the insurgents, at another persuaded
the Northern Witan to submit to Eadred. At length, in a
final insurrection, he was overcome and imprisoned. The affairs in
Northumbria had to be settled. It is here that the national policy
of the dominant party made itself felt. Contrary to the views of
the Wessex nobles, who would have wished for active interference of
the government, the kingdom was reduced to the condition of an
earldom under Osulf. But English supremacy being thus established,
Wulstan was released, and self-government both in Church and State
permitted. This conciliatory policy was interrupted by the death of
Eadred.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Edwy.

<div class="sidenotex">Eadgar.

</div>

<p>The new King Edwy, nephew of Eadred, was a mere child, and a
palace intrigue, headed by Æthelgyfu and her daughter
Ælfgyfu, who had obtained influence over the lad, drove
the Queen Mother Eadgyfu from the Court, and established the power
of the Wessex party. Unpopular among the Wessex nobles and in his
own monastery, Dunstan was driven abroad, and took refuge in Ghent.
But his party was still strong in England. Indignant probably at a
violent resumption of grants from the Folkland, the nobles of England,
with the exception of Wessex, set up Edwy’s younger brother Eadgar
as a rival king, and were sufficiently powerful to oblige Edwy to divide
the kingdom and content himself with the territories of Wessex
south of the Thames. Dunstan was recalled by his partisans. He
received from King Eadgar the sees of Rochester and of
London; and when, on the death of Edwy, Eadgar succeeded
to the undivided sovereignty of the kingdom, Dunstan rose with
him, and became his chief minister and Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Dunstan’s
government.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Division of
Northumbria.</div>
</div>

<p>As minister, Dunstan had both Church and State to reform. In
both, decay had made great progress. The increased importance
of the English King had raised him to a position
very different from that of the tribal monarch. Along with the
King had risen his dependants, the old members of the Comitatus.
His Thegns or servants, rendered rich by grants of the public land,
had gradually succeeded the old nobility by birth, of the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
races. The troubled situation of the country had driven the freeholders
more and more to seek safety by placing themselves and
their land in a state of dependence on the Thegns. Even as early as
Alfred every man was obliged to have a lord. At the same time the
spirit of provincialism was strong, each district which had been a
separate kingdom wishing to maintain its own independence. Dunstan
seems to have understood that a change in the character of the
monarchy was inevitable, and that national unity could only be
secured by upholding that change, placing the monarch in what may
be regarded as an imperial position over the subject kingdoms, and
allowing the separate districts as much self-government as possible.
Within the kingdom of Wessex itself, and perhaps of Mercia also, he
established a strict police, and suppressed disorder with a strong
hand. Beyond that, the largest freedom was permitted. Thus, the
subordination of Northumbria was further secured by
its division into three parts. The district between
the Tees and the Humber was intrusted to Oslac. From the Tees to
the Tweed remained in the hands of Osulf, while the Lothians
between the Tweed and the Forth were given out on military service
to the King of Scotland; and in subsequent history it was this
district, peopled with English and Danes, which formed the civilized
centre of the Scottish kingdom. But, when the supremacy of
Wessex was thus secured, the Danes of the North were allowed to
keep their own customs and make their own laws. Similarly,
friendship with the Northmen of Ireland was maintained, and
through their friendship the King was enabled to keep up a powerful
fleet, which constantly sailed round the coasts, and kept them free
from foreign invasion. The tradition that Eadgar was rowed upon
the Dee to Chester by eight tributary kings, whether the fact be true
or not, points to the imperial position which Dunstan had secured for
him. In the Church the same policy was pursued. The great disturbances
of the kingdom had thrown much power into the hands of
the Church, the most permanent element of society. This increase of
influence had been followed by an increase of secularity. The bishops
became statesmen, and even commanders of armies. The older form
of monasticism died out. Marriage of priests was constant. Livings
began to be handed on from father to son. There was some chance
of the establishment of an hereditary priestly caste. In Ghent, Dunstan
had become acquainted with the Benedictine rule lately established
there. He saw its efficiency for securing discipline among the
clergy. Like other strong rulers, he regarded anarchy with aversion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and was therefore anxious to introduce the rule into England. He
intrusted the work to his friend Æthelwold, whom he made Bishop
of Winchester, and to Oswald, whom he raised to the See of Worcester.
In Wessex and Mercia he carried out his reform with vigour,
even with violence: but, as in his secular government, he kept himself
under the restraints of prudence. Thus, when Oswald was
appointed Archbishop of York, he made no efforts to restrain the
marriage of the clergy, and in Dunstan’s own See he yielded to the
prejudices of the people, and allowed the abbeys to continue in the
hands of secular clerks. The title of Eadgar the Peaceful, and a
reign of seventeen years unbroken by any great foreign war, attest
the success of Dunstan’s policy.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Fall of

</div>

<p>But with Eadgar’s death, and the accession of his son Eadward, this
prosperous state of things ended. For a time Dunstan
held his own, but not without strong opposition. Again
and again he had to plead his cause before the Witan.
And at one synod, at Calne, it was intended to bring the matter to a
crisis. Beornhelm, a Bishop of the Scottish Church, was brought
forward as a champion by his enemies. His eloquence was carrying
the assembly with him, and Dunstan could only appeal to heaven
for assistance. Nor was that assistance denied; by accident or
design, the floor of the upper chamber where the meeting was held
gave way in that part where Beornhelm and his friends were seated,
and they were hurried to swift destruction, while Dunstan’s triumphant
party remained uninjured on the floor above. But even
miraculous interferences did not suppress the enemies
of the Prelate. A conspiracy, in which Ælfthryth
[Elfrida], the mother of Ethelred, seems to have been chiefly engaged,
was formed; and Eadward, returning from the chase, was killed at
her castle at Corfe.</p>

</div>

<p>Eadward the Martyr, as his monkish chroniclers call him, being
thus disposed of, his brother, Æthelred the Unready,
ascended the throne. Dunstan, compelled to assist at
the coronation, did so only to denounce curses on the
new king He had to withdraw from Court. His policy was at an
end. Mercia and the North fell away from Wessex. The King’s
own character, at once weak and cruel, was not such
as to inspire confidence; and we accordingly enter
upon a period of almost inexplicable treasons, weakness, and disorder.
The Danes reappear on the coast, and what has been spoken of as the
third period of Danish invasion begins. The fleets were no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
merely piratical expeditions, but were commanded by kings of whole
countries, and towards the end of the period the object was no longer
plunder, or even settlement, but national conquest. The change
was closely connected with the gradual consolidation of the three
Northern kingdoms of Europe&mdash;Norway, Sweden, and Denmark,
in each of which, as in England, one sovereign had now become
paramount. The chief personage in these invasions is Swegen or
Swend, son of the King of Denmark. In the year 982 he made his
appearance on the English coasts, and Southampton, Chester, and
London were either taken or destroyed. The kingdom was in no
condition to offer a firm resistance. Internal dissensions had already
begun. The King was at enmity with the whole of Dunstan’s party.
We hear of a fierce quarrel with the Bishop of Rochester. The
allegiance of Mercia and Northumbria was more than doubtful.
East Anglia, where resistance to a kindred people might have been
least expected, alone succeeded in checking the Danes. There,
under Brihtnoth, the great battle of Maldon was fought,
which forms the subject of one of the greatest of the
Anglo-Saxon poems. Such single instances of resistance
were of no real avail. Sigeric of Canterbury, who had succeeded to
Dunstan’s position and policy, and was therefore by no means
unfriendly to the Danes as the opponents of Wessex, induced the
King to entertain a fatal plan of buying off the invaders. With the
consent of his Witan, he raised £10,000, with which he bribed the
Danish hosts. This was the origin of the tax known as
Danegelt, which became permanent, and lasted till the
reign of Henry II. The effect of such a bribe was naturally
only to excite the Northern robbers to further efforts. Accordingly,
in 994, Swegen and Olaf of Norway made their appearance, and England
was assaulted by the national fleets of Denmark and Norway.
Divided by faction, undermined by treason, and without a leader,
the English knew no expedient but the repetition of bribes. Olaf,
as a Christian, was indeed induced to return to his own country, but
Swegen’s invasions were continuous. Supported by the disloyal
chiefs of the North, he ravaged in turn Dorsetshire, Hampshire,
Sussex, and Kent. And when, in the year 1000, a temporary lull
occurred, Æthelred, with a madness which seems almost inconceivable,
insisted on quarrelling, first with the King of Cumberland, who
is said to have refused the disgraceful tribute demanded of him,
though willing to serve with his forces against the Danes, and
afterwards with the Normans in France. An expedition undertaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
against this people with ridiculous ostentation was easily defeated.
A peace was made, and hostility changed into alliance,
cemented by the marriage of the King with Emma, a
Norman Princess. In her train came certain followers,
who obtained high office and military commands, and added a fresh
element of weakness to already weakened England. But though
contemptible in the field, with the craft and cruelty of a weak mind
Æthelred planned the massacre of all the Danes in
Wessex. Many of these were settled quietly in different
parts of the country, or billeted and living on friendly
terms with their landlords. On the 13th of November 1002, on the
festival of St. Brice, the cruel plan was carried out. Among other
victims was a sister of Swegen’s who had become a Christian; she was
put to death with circumstances of unusual barbarity, it is said, at the
instigation of Eadric <em>Streona</em>, or <em>the Gainer</em>. This man
henceforward plays a prominent part in the history.
Though of low birth, he had contrived to make himself
the favourite of the King, whose daughter he subsequently married.
Selfish, unscrupulous, and treacherous, his influence as the King’s
adviser was most pernicious; while, if it suited his own ends, he
never hesitated to betray his master. So completely is he identified
with the disasters of England, that there is scarcely any criminal act
of the reign that is not traced to him. But his repeated treasons do
not seem to have destroyed the trust which Æthelred and his nobler
son Edmund placed in him. After the massacre of St. Brice the
Danes naturally sought revenge. Exeter was taken by the treachery
of Hugh the Frenchman, one of Emma’s followers. Wiltshire and
Salisbury were deserted by the traitor Ælfric. Again East Anglia,
under Ulfcytel the Ealdorman, made the only show of resistance;
but here too, treason, not of the commander but of the soldiers,
themselves of Danish origin, proved fatal. Famine and civil quarrels
added to the misery of the English. Again Eadric is visible,
ruining rival Thegns, and advising still further use of bribes. In
1006, he had succeeded in getting made Ealdorman of the Mercians.
His family rose with him, and in 1008, when at last a great national
fleet was collected, the quarrels of his brother Brihtric and his
nephew Wulfnoth destroyed its utility.</p>

Ipswich, and the country was in a condition of absolute collapse.
Mercia and Wessex itself were overrun. The cause of Æthelred
looked so hopeless, that Eadric the Gainer thought it time to change
sides, and after the capture of Canterbury and the death of the
Archbishop St. Alphege, the Witan was collected under Eadric,
without the participation of the King, and a further large tribute
paid, while by some arrangement, probably the cession of East
Anglia, Thurkill was drawn to the English side. This step of
Thurkill seems to have opened Swegen’s eyes at once
to the inutility of single invasions, and to the possibility
of himself effecting some similar arrangement. He felt confident
of the support of Northumbria and Mercia against Wessex.
He therefore moved his fleet to the Humber, and advanced to York.
He had not miscalculated. The whole of the Danelagu joined him,
and with this assistance, leaving his son Cnut behind him in command
of the fleet in the Humber, he advanced into Wessex. His
success was constant. Oxford was taken, and the royal town of
Winchester. At Bath the Danish conqueror received the submission
of the Thegns of the West. London, which we find constantly
rising in importance, alone held out, nor was it till Æthelred
deserted the city that it surrendered. But then, there
being no longer any opposition, Swegen was, in fact,
King of England. Æthelred sought and obtained an
asylum in Normandy, till recalled by Swegen’s death the following
year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Restoration of
Æthelred.
1014.</div>

<p>The Danes acknowledged Cnut as King, but the bulk of the English
wished to retain the House of Cerdic, if Æthelred
would pledge himself to rule better. This he promised
to do, and his cause for a time was successful. Cnut had
to retreat to his ships. Nevertheless, we hear of another large tribute,
but it was paid probably to a fleet of Danish auxiliaries serving upon
the English side. Eadric had of course again joined the victorious
party; but again his persistent treachery was the destruction of the
country. He enticed Sigeferth and Morkere, Thegns of the Five
Danish Burghs, to Oxford, and there murdered them. Sigeferth’s
widow was kept a prisoner, and taken in marriage by Edmund Ironside,
Æthelred’s son. This prince thus acquired possession of the Five
Burghs, and secured an influence which enabled him to take up a
position in opposition to Eadric. On the renewal of the invasion by
Cnut both Eadric and Edmund collected their forces; but, angry at the
new rivalry he was experiencing, Eadric led his troops to join Cnut.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Wessex was thus thrown open, and by a strange inversion of affairs,
Edmund, with Utred of Northumberland, occupied the northern part
of England, while the Danes, under Cnut and Eadric, held Wessex
and the South. In 1016, Æthelred died.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Division of

</div>

<p>The Witan of the South immediately, under the influence of the
conquerors, elected Cnut as his successor, but London
and the rest of the Witan chose Edmund. It was plain
that Wessex could acknowledge Cnut only through fear,
and thither Edmund betook himself, and collected troops. As if to
prove what the English could do if well commanded, in a few weeks
he fought, on the whole successfully, five great battles.
At Pen Selwood in Somerset; at Sherstone, where the
English were only prevented from winning by a trick of Eadric’s,
who, raising the head of another man, declared it was the head of
the slain English king; at Brentford; and afterwards, when Eadric
had again changed sides, at Otford in Kent; and Assandun in Essex.
In this last battle the whole forces of England were arrayed. The
sudden withdrawal of Eadric, who was commanding the Magesætas,
or men of Hereford, secured a victory for the Danes, and Edmund had
to retreat across England into the country of the Hwiccas, or Gloucestershire.
Not yet wholly beaten, he was preparing for a sixth
battle, when he was persuaded to make an arrangement similar,
though not identical, with that which Alfred had made
with Guthrum. He surrendered to Cnut Northumberland
and Mercia, retaining for himself Wessex, Essex, East Anglia,
and London. On St. Andrew’s Day of the same year, Edmund
Ironside died, a misfortune, like most other <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'acts of villany'">acts of villainy</ins> of the
time, attributed to Eadric. With him fell the hope of the English.
The treachery of Eadric, the folly of Æthelred, met with their reward,
and Cnut was acknowledged King of England.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Cnut’s patriotic

</div>

<p>Indeed, Edmund’s sons were so young that it was not probable
that the Witan would elect them. The only other claimant was
Edwy, Edmund’s brother. To secure himself against
him, Cnut is said to have employed Eadric to put him
to death; and though he escaped on that occasion, he was certainly
outlawed, and all the old members of the royal family
were kept abroad. The children of Æthelred and Emma, Edward
and Alfred, were in Normandy with their mother. The children of
Edmund Ironside, Edward and Edmund, were sent first to Sweden,
and then to Hungary, where Edward married Agatha, niece of the
Emperor Henry II. Cnut’s object, on finding himself King of England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
appears to have been to obliterate, as far as possible, the idea of
conquest, to rule England as an English king, and making that
country the centre of his government, to form a great Scandinavian
Empire. To this end, pursuing the policy of Dunstan, he divided
England into four great earldoms, representing the old
kingdoms. Northumberland and East Anglia were
intrusted to Danes; Mercia was given to Eadric; Wessex he kept in
his own hands. Eadric’s influence had compelled Cnut thus to promote
him, but he so mistrusted him, that within a year he caused
him to be put to death. In the same year he sent for Queen Emma
from Normandy, and married her, though she must have been much
older than himself, with the object apparently either of
connecting himself with the late dynasty, or of securing
the friendship of the Normans. The next year the Danish fleet was
sent home. Englishmen were again put in high office. Thus Leofric
was made Earl of the Mercians, and Godwine, of whom we now
first hear, and whose origin and rise is variously related, was made
Earl of Wessex, presumably the second man in the country. Thus,
too, Cnut flattered the feelings of the English by moving the body of
St. Alphege, who had been killed by the Danes twelve years before,
with all honour to his own Church at Canterbury; and thus, too, he
did not scruple to fill the English bishoprics with Englishmen, and
even to promote them to high office in Denmark. During his reign
England was at peace within its own borders, while Scotland was
brought to submission. In 1031, Malcolm, King of the Scotch,
and two under-kings, did homage to the English King. A strong,
well-ordered government was established, supported for the first
time by a standing body of troops, known as the House-carls. Early
in the reign Eadgar’s law had been renewed with the advice of the
Witan, and, in 1028, Cnut promulgated a code of his own, which is
little else than repetition of former laws and customs. But the proof
of his good government is this, that just as the law of the great
Eadgar was looked on as typical, and demanded by Cnut’s Witan,
and as after the Conquest the Confessor’s law was demanded, so we
find the people of the North demanding Cnut’s law,&mdash;in each case
law meaning system of government. His importance as a king is
marked by the respect shown him on his pilgrimage to Rome in the
year 1027. There, as he tells his people in a letter which he sent
them, he negotiated with the Pope, the Emperor, and King Rudolph
of Burgundy, for the free passage of English pilgrims and merchants;
he received large gifts from the Emperor, and made the Pope promise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to lessen his extortions upon granting the Pallium or Archiepiscopal
cloak. His daughter by Queen Emma, Gunhild, was, moreover,
thought a fitting wife for Henry, afterwards the Emperor Henry III.

</div>

<p>With him fell his plans, both of the Scandinavian Empire and of
good government in England. His sons, Harold and
Harthacnut, in no way inherited his greatness; they
appear to have been little better than savage barbarians. The succession
was disputed between them. Godwine and the West Saxons
obtained the South of England for Harthacnut, while Harold reigned
in the North. But as Harthacnut did not come to England, but
remained in his kingdom of Denmark, Godwine was
the practical ruler. This great Earl, whose sympathies
were wholly national, was accused of putting to death Alfred, the
son of Æthelred and Emma, who seems to have taken advantage of
the absence of Harthacnut to aim at re-establishing himself in Wessex.
But as the actual murderers were the men of Harold whom Godwine
had opposed, it would seem that the charge was a false one. The
continued absence of Harthacnut enabled Harold to
secure the whole of the kingdom, over which he
reigned for two years. On his death, in 1040, Harthacnut
stepped unopposed into his position. His short
reign was marked by no great events. Godwine, having cleared
himself by oath and by compurgation (in which a large number of
Earls and Thegns joined) of the charge of murdering Alfred,
remained in power. A tyrannical use of the King’s House-carls in
collecting a tax produced an outbreak in Worcester, which was
punished with brutal severity. And when the King fell dead,
while drinking at a bridal feast, the English were glad to be rid
of a line of such barbarous sovereigns, and to restore the House of
Cerdic in the person of the late king’s half-brother Edward, who,
in the absence of direct descendants of the Danish house, entered
almost unopposed on the kingdom.</p>

</div>

<p>It was the eloquence of Godwine which overcame the slight opposition
offered to Edward’s election, and secured him the throne.
This nobleman thus reached the summit of his power, and
two years afterwards his daughter Edith became the King’s
wife. Edward’s education and training had rendered his tastes and
policy as decidedly French as those of Godwine were national. There
thence arose, and continued throughout the reign, a constant enmity
between the two parties&mdash;the Frenchmen, whom Edward brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
over in great numbers and employed particularly as bishops, and
the national party, headed by Godwine and his sons.
It is the progress of this quarrel which forms the history
of the reign, side by side with the efforts of Godwine to
push his family prominently forward in opposition to the family of
Leofric, Earl of Mercia. On the one hand, the King lavished favours
upon his foreign followers. A Frenchman, Robert of Jumièges,
became Bishop of London, and afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury;
Ulf, another Norman, became Bishop of Dorchester in Oxfordshire;
Ralph, the son of Edward’s sister and the Count of Mantes, was made
an Earl; and Eustace of Boulogne, her second husband, was loaded
with honours. On the other hand, Godwine succeeded in securing
for members of his own family the earldoms of Somersetshire and
Herefordshire, and of the East and Middle Angles. The crisis of the
rivalry at length arrived. It arose from an outrage committed by
the followers of Eustace on the citizens of Dover. The townsmen
rose against the insolent Normans and drove them from the city;
and when Godwine, as Earl, was called upon to punish the citizens,
he positively refused unless they were fairly tried before the Witan.
Both sides took up arms,&mdash;Godwine and his sons on one side; the
King, with Siward of Northumberland, Leofric of Mercia, and his
own French partisans on the other. The armies faced each other in
Gloucestershire; but Godwine, unwilling to press matters to extremity,
accepted the proposal of Leofric that the question should be referred
to the Witan. When the Witan assembled, the King was there with
a great army. Overawed by this force, the Witan, recurring to the
old charge against Godwine and to a late act of violence on the part
of his son Swend, ordered Godwine and his sons to appear before
them as criminals. This they refused to do unless hostages were
given, and as this demand was refused, they would not appear, and
were outlawed. Godwine and three sons retired to
Baldwin of Bruges, Leofwine and Harold to Ireland.
The French party were triumphant. Robert, as we have
seen, was made Archbishop, William, another Frenchman, succeeded
him as Bishop of London, and Odda, probably an Englishman in the
French interest, was given the western part of Godwine’s earldom.
Harold’s earldom was given to Ælfgar, son of Leofric. At the same
time, to complete the French influence, William of Normandy came
over to England, and, as he always declared, received a promise of the
succession from his cousin Edward.</p>

<p>The administration of foreigners was so unpopular and so unsuccessful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
that Godwine and his family thought that an opportunity
had arisen for their return. Unable to procure their restoration by
peaceful means, they determined upon using force; and after various
expeditions, but feebly opposed by the English, who at heart wished
them well, Godwine found himself strong enough to sail up the
Thames; and so preponderating was the feeling of the country in his
favour, that, as the King refused justice, it was agreed that the
matter should be referred to the Witan. What their decision would
be was not doubtful, so the French prelates and earls and
knights, who had been building feudal castles, at once
fled, and Godwine and his sons came back in triumph.
Stigand, a priest, who had been originally appointed by
Cnut to an abbey raised at Assandun in memory of the Danish
victory over Edmund Ironside, and who had acted as principal
mediator, was elected to the Archbishopric of Canterbury, left vacant
by the flight of Robert. The next year Earl Godwine died suddenly,
while at dinner with the King.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> His death restored the balance
between the two great families. While Harold succeeded to the
earldom of the West Saxons, and the vacant earldom of Northumbria
was given to his brother Tostig, East Anglia was restored to Leofric’s
son Ælfgar. Earl Siward of Northumbria had died in 1055.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="sidenotex">Death of

</div>

<p>The succeeding years are marked by the gradual increase of the
power of Harold and his family. In 1055 Earl Ælfgar
was outlawed, and his earldom given to Gurth, Harold’s
brother. The exiled Earl, making common cause with Griffith
[Gryffydd] of Wales, defeated Ralph, the French Earl of Herefordshire.
To repair this disaster the war was intrusted to Harold; he
prosecuted it with success, and Herefordshire, which he had thus
rescued, was added to his earldom. The death of Leofric still further
increased the power of the House of Godwine, although Ælfgar, the
late Earl, was allowed to succeed him; and finally, Essex and Kent
were formed into an earldom for Leofwine, the remaining brother of
Harold. Godwine’s sons now possessed all England, with the exception
of Mercia. The last probable heir to the throne&mdash;the Ætheling
Edward, the son of Edmund Ironside&mdash;had been brought over from
Hungary, but had died almost immediately after reaching England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
And when, in 1063, Harold, by employing his men as light troops,
succeeded in the final subjugation of Wales, his greatness was such
that he must almost certainly have been regarded as the next king.
Three years afterwards, in January 1066, King Edward,
the last male descendant of Cerdic who reigned in
England, died. His last year had been troubled by a
great insurrection of the Northern counties against the rule of Tostig.
The house of Leofric had had a stronghold in the North, and Tostig’s
injudicious vigour in attempting to reduce the barbarous population
to order had excited great discontent. His energy seems more than
once to have led him into murder. The Northumbrian therefore
deposed him, and elected Morcar [Morkere], the grandson of Leofric,
in his place. His brother, Edwin of Mercia, who had succeeded
his father Ælfgar, made common cause with him; and Harold,
whose policy was always conciliatory, found it necessary to persuade
the King to confirm Edwin and Morkere in their possessions.
Tostig retired as an exile to Bruges. While England was thus
troubled, the King died&mdash;a good man, devoted to the Church and
the monks, and therefore afterwards canonized, but as a king
unfitted by his pliant character, and more especially by his love of
foreign favourites, to rule over England at such a difficult crisis.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Claims of
William of
Normandy.</div>
</div>

<p>The Witan at once assembled, and used its power of election. This
power was usually exercised within the limits of the royal family;
but on this occasion, as there was no claimant of the royal house but
Edmund Ironside’s grandson, the child Eadgar, the Witan looked
beyond their usual limit, and elected almost unanimously
the great Earl Harold. Though thus King of England
by the most perfect title, he found himself opposed
by two enemies. On the one hand was his brother Tostig, the exiled
Earl of Northumberland, who had been a favourite of the late king,
and had perhaps himself hoped to be elected; and upon the other
Duke William, who, out of a variety of small and insufficient
pretexts, had constructed a very formidable
claim to the crown of England. He asserted that the
Confessor had promised him the kingdom, that he was the nearest
of kin, and that Harold had himself sworn to him to be his man,
to marry his daughter, and to own him allegiance. The circumstances
under which this last event had taken place are not very
certain; but it seems to be true that Harold, on some occasion, had
been shipwrecked on the coast of France and taken prisoner, and
held to ransom, according to the barbarous custom of that day, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Guy, Count of Ponthieu, lord of the country. The intervention of
William as superior lord rescued him from his disgraceful position.
He spent some time in friendly intercourse at William’s court, and
there probably, as was not unusual, made himself the Duke’s man,
and did homage. Such an act could be only personal, and could
have nothing to do with the kingdom of England, and even as a
personal tie was not very binding. It was his knowledge of this
which induced William to play the well-known trick upon Harold.
When the Earl had taken what he believed to be only a common oath
of homage, the cover of the table on which his hands had been
placed was withdrawn, and he found he had been swearing upon
most sacred relics. With regard to the other claims, it may be said
that Edward the Confessor, in accordance with the constitution
of England, could not promise the crown to any one, and, moreover,
had nominated Harold on his deathbed; while, although William
was the cousin of the late king, it was only through Edward’s
Norman mother, Emma, that he was so. But when put forward
artfully, and mingled with coloured accounts of the injuries suffered
by the French in England at the return of Godwine, these claims
seemed very plausible to the French, especially when backed by the
influence of the Papal See wielded by Archdeacon Hildebrand,
afterwards Pope Gregory VII. The Papal support was won partly
by representing Harold as a perjured man, partly because the
Normans in Italy were regarded as the great champions of the Papal
See, but chiefly because Godwine and Harold had throughout sided
rather with the party of the secular clergy in England than with that
of the monks,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and had been national in their views with regard to the
Church as well as in other matters. The Pope, Alexander II., was led
by Hildebrand to see the opportunity offered, and expressed his approbation
of the expedition by sending a consecrated ring and banner.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">William’s

<div class="sidenotex">Tostig’s
invasion.</div>
</div>

<p>William, immediately after the death of the Confessor, sent to
demand the crown, which was of course refused. He
then proceeded to collect troops, not only his own
Norman feudatories, but also large bodies of adventurers from other
parts of France. Aware of the intended invasion, Harold collected
his forces, and occupied the Southern coast. But William was so
long in coming, that Harold’s militia army, anxious to return to their
agricultural works, and straitened for food, could not be kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
together. He was left with his immediate followers, his House-carls
and Thegns. Just then, when his great host had disappeared, news
was brought to him that Tostig had invaded the North
of England. Foiled in a weak attempt upon the South
near Sandwich, and refused aid by William of Normandy, Tostig had
fallen in with the fleet of Harold Hardrada, King of Norway. This
king was a great warrior, who had served in the armies of the
Byzantine Empire, and fought in Africa and Sicily. He was easily
persuaded to join Tostig, and reinforced by the Earls of Orkney, they
together sailed up the Ouse, and reached Fulford on the way
to York. Edwin and Morkere, the sons of Ælfgar, whose sister
Harold had lately married, honestly opposed them, but after a
severe battle they were beaten. Arrangements by which the
North was to join Harold Hardrada were being made at Stamford
Bridge upon the Derwent, when Harold, who had hastened with
extreme rapidity from the South, fell upon the invaders. They were
taken by surprise, and some, but slightly armed, were overcome; but
the bridge over the Derwent was held with determination, and a fierce
battle was fought on the other side. The English were entirely triumphant,
both Tostig and Harold Hardrada being slain. The Norwegian
fleet was forced to withdraw. This was on the 25th of September.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Death of
Harold.</div>
</div>

<p>On the 28th King William landed at Pevensey. Harold was still
at York when the news reached him. He hastily
gathered what troops he could round the nucleus of his
own immediate followers who had been with him at Stamford
Bridge. All the South of England joined him gladly, both from
Wessex and East Anglia. But Edwin and Morkere, in their jealousy
of the rival house, forgot their patriotism and Harold’s good deeds to
themselves, and deserted him. With such an army as he had, Harold
took up his position upon the hill of Senlac, where Battle Abbey now
stands. This hill runs out from the North Sussex hills southward
like a peninsula. There Harold erected palisades, and
arranged his men with a view to defensive action only.
This step was rendered necessary by the difference of
the armies; the English fought all on foot, a large proportion were
irregularly armed militia, and the hand javelin&mdash;not the bow and
arrow&mdash;was their national missile. The Normans, on the other
hand, fought as chivalry on horseback, and had many archers. Once
in the plain Harold’s army might have been crushed by the charge
of the mailed cavalry. But repeated charges uphill against an
entrenched foe, stubborn and heavily armed, could not but wear out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the mounted knight. Our descriptions are all from Norman sources,
and the contrast between the religious Norman and the jovial
Englishman is fully brought out. On the one side, the night is said
to have been passed in prayer, and on the other in revelry. There
were certainly, however, priests and monks upon the side of the
English, and probably this story is a monkish exaggeration. Harold
drew up his forces with his own picked troops upon the front of the
hill, between the dragon banner of Wessex and his own banner
adorned with a fighting man. The backward curves of the hill were
occupied by his worse armed troops. He himself, with his brothers
Gyrth and Leofwine, took their place beside the standard. The
French advanced in three divisions,&mdash;the Bretons, under Alan, on
the left; the Normans, under their Duke and his two brothers,
Robert and Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, in the centre; the adventurers,
under Roger of Montgomery, on the right. They galloped forward,
preceded by Taillefer, a minstrel, tossing his sword aloft and singing
songs of Charlemagne. But their efforts were vain. The heavy axe
of the English hewed down man and horse if any reached the
barricade, and the French had to draw back. The Bretons began
the flight, and the Normans soon followed, but the English militia
were not steady enough to withstand the excitement of victory. The
veteran centre stood firm, but the troops opposed to the Bretons broke
from their position in pursuit. William saw his advantage, rallied
his troops, drove back the pursuers, and made a second vehement
assault upon the barricade. The Earls Gyrth and Leofwine were
killed, the barricade in part removed, but still Harold held his
ground, and William had to have recourse to stratagem before he
could secure a victory. His present comparative success had been
caused by the accidental over-eagerness of the English. He determined
to try whether he could not again induce them to break their
line. The Normans turned in apparent flight, the English, heated
by the long fight, rushed forward in pursuit. The Norman cavalry
turned round and rode down their pursuers, and, driving them before
them, again charged up the hill; while the archers, whose skill had
been somewhat foiled by the shields of the English, were ordered to
drop a flight of arrows upon the heads of Harold and his men. The
plan was fatally successful; the battle was still stubbornly contested,
though no longer in serried ranks, when Harold fell,
pierced in the eye by an arrow. With him disappeared
all hope of English success. His body was found, and buried under
a cairn by the sea, till afterwards removed to his minster of Waltham.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Mark
system.</div>

<p class="drop-cap">The chief interest in the Conquest is the change that it is always
said to have exercised in the character of the institutions of
England. It used to be asserted that the feudal system was introduced,
and completed as a wholly new system to the English, after
the Conquest; and Hume speaks of the division of the kingdom into
so many knights’ fiefs, into so many baronies, as if there were complete
reorganization of the whole constitution. Modern inquiry
tends to confirm what would naturally have been supposed, that the
whole of the elements of the feudal system existed in England as in
other Teutonic countries before the arrival of the Normans. The form
which the civilization of the Scandinavian and Teutonic
nations took seems to have been that of a collection of
village communities, such as may be seen at work at present in India.
The district occupied by such community was called the Mark, and was
divided into three parts, in each of which every free member of the
community had his share, but which were cultivated in strict accordance
with the customary system of agriculture which no one might break.
There was first the village, then the arable mark (cultivated land),
then the common pasture, and beyond that the waste. Every freeman
had a share in the arable and in the common pasture, but he
was bound to sow the same crops as his neighbours, and to follow the
same arrangement, which appears to have been simple and barbarous.
The common fields, or mixed lands as they are called, were divided
into three strips by broad grassy mounds; one was sown with
autumn crops, one with spring crops, and the third left fallow. In
the same way, though under somewhat varying rules, the grass mark
was partitioned. Frequently all enclosures were removed at the
close of the hay harvest, and the cattle grazed in common, as they
were allowed to do also in the stubble of the arable mark. Lands
were probably redistributed at certain intervals of time, and the
power of devising hereditary property by will was strictly restrained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Traces of common fields cultivated on the threefold system, and of
customary cultivation, are still to be found in England, and were
plentiful in the last century.</p>

institutions.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Division
of ranks.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">The Comitatus.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Growth of
feudalism.</div>
</div>

<p>But though this system would appear to have been common in nations
of Germanic origin, it can be gathered from the Germania
of Tacitus that other political institutions existed in Germany.
Thus, the subdivisions of the Tribe were called Pagi, which seem
to answer to the English Hundred. The Pagus was under the official
chieftainship of an elective head called the Princeps, answering to the
Saxon Ealdorman. This Pagus, which may perhaps have been originally
a division of a hundred heads of families, supplied a hundred
warriors to the host, a hundred assessors at the Judicial Court of the
Princeps. Below this we come to the Vicus or township, which was probably
organized upon the Mark system above described, or on some
modification of it. The commanders in war, or Duces, were elected,
probably from among the Principes, for each special occasion. It is,
moreover, clear that private property had begun to exist. In pastoral
life, where the common right of grazing would be the chief common
privilege, there would be no difficulty in one man possessing more
cattle than another. Neither would it be a great step to grant to such
wealthier men, upon the redivision of the common arable mark, extra
shares for the support of slaves or dependent freemen whom his wealth
had attracted around him. There also existed a variety of ranks, which
may be roughly divided into three classes,&mdash;the noble or
<em>eorl</em>, who must have owed his nobility to birth; the freeman
or <em>ceorl</em>, possessing his own homestead, his own share in the common
land, and dependent on no man; and the <em>læt</em> or dependent workman,
cultivating his lord’s land. Besides these, there were actual slaves or
<em>theows</em>, consisting of men who had lost their liberty either as captives,
or for debt, or for some other easily conceivable causes. It does not
appear that nobility of birth gave any additional political rights,
although personal consideration was awarded to the noble. It was the
possession of free land which made a man a full member of the tribe.
The læts, however, were probably dependent only as regarded their
lord, in every other respect free. Thus, like other members of the
community, their death had to be atoned for by the payment of a
sum of money or <em>weregild</em>, although the sum was smaller than in the
case of freemen. They probably formed a considerable part of the
armed force of the nation. The class may have consisted originally
of a conquered population of kindred blood, or of men who voluntarily
put themselves into a state of dependency upon their richer neighbours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
for security, or because for some reason they had become landless. Side
by side with this democratic constitution, there was a peculiar institution
known as the <em>Comitatus</em>. Each Princeps was allowed to
collect around him, under a tie of personal dependence,
a body of professed warriors, who were bound to him by the closest
ties of honour; and the importance of each chief must have depended
in a great degree upon this following. In case of conquest, it would
naturally be the duty of the conquering chief to see to the welfare of
his followers, and to give them grants, which might either be grants
in perpetuity, or only the right of present possession, and which would
be drawn from the conquered land remaining over after its distribution
among the body of freemen. To cultivate these grants, the comrades
of the king would have had to employ their own dependants, and
these dependants would settle in villages, which took the form of
village communities, except that the rights, which in the free communities
would be vested in the whole body of the freemen, were in
this case vested in the lord. We here have the germ of the relation
between vassal and lord. But this element of feudalism
soon acquired greater strength. The conquering chief
would take upon himself the title of king, claim descent from the gods,
and make his line hereditary. As the position of the king advanced, the
position of the comrade or Gesith would advance also. As the king
of a tribe became the king of a nation his dignity would greatly
increase, and with his that of his followers, who, as the court
became more formal, would accept as honours duties about the household,
and the word <em>Gesith</em>, comrade, changed into <em>Thegn</em> or servant.
In times of war such nobles by service became natural leaders of the
people, and the position of the chief men of the village proportionately
sunk. So that there arose a class of nobles in immediate
connection with the crown, possessing property not belonging to a
village community, and exercising rights of lordship over its inhabitants.
It is not difficult to see in what a superior position they were
thus placed; what powers of encroachment they might have; and
how willingly, in times of danger, village communities would put
themselves in the same position with regard to them, as that occupied
by those settlers on the Thegn’s lands, who had always acknowledged
them as their lords. We have therefore two sources from which feudalism
might have arisen; the village headman, in accordance with what
seems to be a general law, as his powers came to be legally defined
(especially in the matter of collecting the king’s taxes), would be
regarded as the hereditary lord of the village, and would obtain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
right of permanently enclosing his share of the common land; while
the king’s Thegn, side by side with him, would plant his own subject
villages, and accept by what is called <em>commendation</em> the supremacy
of such villages as might offer it to him.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Land.</div>
</div>

<p>The Saxons then brought with them, in their invasion of England,
their threefold division of rank, their association or
township, their Pagus or Hundred, the Mark system, the
principle of election to public functions, and the Comitatus
or personal following of their chiefs. The conquering
Principes or Ealdormen became kings. The country in all probability
was divided out with some degree of regularity between
villages, similar in constitution with those of Continental Germany.
There was no necessity for these apportionments being equal. But a
certain number of villages, whatever their property was, were divided
into Pagi or Hundreds. This explains the inequality of those divisions.
The unoccupied land was left in the king’s hands to reward
his chief followers. On these demesnes, and on the public
lands, the <em>læts</em> found their homes, with such of the conquered race as
remained; and from time to time fresh estates were granted as fresh
conquests increased the surplus land. From this land also the monasteries
were endowed. The portion allotted to each free household was
called the <em>Hide</em>. Land held by hereditary possession or by original
allotment was called the <em>Ethel</em>. That held by grant from the public land
and by charter was called <em>Bocland</em> (<em>i.e.</em> book-land). The land neither
partitioned nor granted was the common property of the nation, and
was called <em>Folcland</em>. As all land, whether bocland or folcland, could
be let out, and was so treated on various conditions, there was much
variety in the tenures of that class of people who did not possess free
land of their own.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Judicial
organization.</div>

<p>Whether the mark system prevailed to any great extent or not, (and
this is a somewhat uncertain point,) practically it was the township which
formed the lowest part of the general organization. The
hundred was a collection of townships, the shire a collection
of hundreds. The chief officer of the township, the town reeve, was
elected by the freeholders of the township, and with four of their number
represented that township in the Court of the Hundred, of which the
township was a subordinate division. Townships established upon the
lands of lords also had their reeve, but probably he was appointed by the
lord. Their constitution was the same, but the proprietor of the soil took
the duties and privileges which in a free township belonged to the freeholders.
Such townships formed manors. It was from the township<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
also that the burghs or towns arose. The Saxons had a natural dislike
for town life, and we must not look for the arrangements of the borough
to the remnants of Roman civilization. But when the village grew very
large the same constitution as existed in the township was employed,
the freeholders within the limits of the borough forming the municipal
body. Such boroughs may also frequently have arisen from an
agglomeration of townships. They would then be analogous to the
hundred. The existence of two or three parishes in most boroughs
leads to the same conclusion; for, ecclesiastically, the limits of the
township and the parish were the same. Such towns, growing up
naturally round the dwellings of wealthy men or of the king, would
generally be either on folcland, and as such, dependent upon the crown,
or upon the land of some lord on whom they would then depend.
When the national system became organized, there would thus be the
Court of the Township, with its counterpart in the dependent Township
of the Manor Court. Above that, the Hundred Court, presided
over by the Hundred-man, while the township were represented by
their Reeve and four members. And above that there was the Shire
Court or Gemot. The shires were not, properly speaking, part of
the original organization. They seem to be in most cases the old
sub-kingdoms. The Court, therefore, of the Shire represented the
National Court. Over these sub-kingdoms or shires was appointed a
royal officer, shire-reeve or sheriff, representative of the king for
judicial and fiscal purposes. There is no proof that he was an
elective officer. Beside the sheriff, who represented the central
authority, was the Ealdorman, who had the command of the military
force of the shire and the third of the fines levied. He was the
representative of the old sub-king. He was a national officer,
appointed by the king and by the central assembly of the nation, the
Witana-Gemot. He sat with the sheriff in the Shire Court, but it
would seem that the sheriff was the official whose presence constituted
the court. In all the courts it was a principle that the suitors of the
court, those, that is, who were liable to its jurisdiction, were also the
judges; that is to say, the courts were essentially popular. The
whole body present settled the disputes or judged the crimes of
the individuals, the chief officer being, in fact, the chairman. Practically,
in the Shire Court, twelve chief Thegns or chief freeholders
sat with the sheriff as judges, representatives of the whole body. It
was also a principle, at all events originally, that no superior court
should have jurisdiction till the inferior courts had done their best
towards the settlement of the disputed point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Ecclesiastically, the parishes were co-extensive with the townships,
the bishoprics in a great degree co-extensive with the shires or ancient
kingdoms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Growth of
territorial
jurisdiction.</div>

<p>In process of time, the position of the king somewhat changed.
He began to be regarded as the one lord of the land. From being
the King of the Saxons he gradually became the King of England.
His personal relation became territorial. The folcland became royal
demesne, and the king came to be regarded as the origin of justice.
This change, among other causes, tended much to the
growth of a system which was in fact incipient feudalism.
The national courts constantly became more the private
courts of great lords. The connection between the possession of land
and the judicial power grew constantly stronger. It had early been the
custom to establish in the favour of lords to whom grants were made
Liberties, or <em>Soken</em>, as they were called; that is, land was granted
exempted from the jurisdiction of the Hundred. The judicial rights
of the Hundred, together with the payments accruing from them,
were vested in the lord who received the grant. These rights are implied
in the words <em>sac</em> and <em>soc</em>. As townships on a lord’s land became
manors, so these Liberties, on which there were many townships,
became private Hundreds. They were probably, before the Conquest,
not exempted from the jurisdiction of the Shire. It has been already
mentioned that, either by commendation or by the encroachment of
local magnates, freemen (allodial proprietors as they were called) took in
many cases the position of dependants. Their property then assumed
the character of bocland, or land held by charter, instead of hereditary
freehold. By commending themselves to a lord they would free themselves
from the burden of military duty, which would then fall upon
the lord as proprietor of the land. Justice would be more easily obtained
from the neighbouring court of the lord than from the distant court
of the Hundred or county. Protection from invasion or from the
violence of neighbours would be gained. Again, the police regulation,
by which all landless men were obliged to seek a lord, would
strengthen the idea of the necessity of dependence.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Franchises and territorial jurisdictions went on
increasing till the ideas of possession of land and jurisdiction began
to go constantly together. The Thegn, who only possessed five
Hides, had his court. In the time of Cnut a further step was taken.
The wealthy landowner, under the name of Landrica, represented
the king in his district, and had jurisdiction over the lesser freeholders.
While, to crown all, the new position of the king gave him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the sole jurisdiction over the holders of bocland, to which, as we
have seen, allodial property was gradually assimilating itself. In all
these ways private and territorial jurisdictions were strengthened,
and enabled very largely to encroach upon the national and popular
courts. The position of the Landrica was little else than that of a
feudal baron, and the independence of the great hereditary official,
so marked a characteristic of Continental feudalism, was almost reproduced
in England, when Cnut divided the kingdom into four great
Earldoms.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Central
government.
The Witan.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Increased power
of the King.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Finance.</div>
</div>

<p>To pass from the local government to the central. It has been
seen that justice and municipal law were carried on through a
series of free assemblies or Gemots; so too the general meeting, or
Gemot of the nation, constituted the chief legislative and judicial
assembly. This was called the Witan or wise men, or the
Witana-Gemot or assembly of wise men. It was doubtless
originally the National Assembly of all free men, but by an
easy change which befalls all such assemblies, attendance on it grew
awkward to the multitude, and was shortly confined to those who bore
office about the court, the king’s Thegns and bishops. The principle of
representation was not understood, and the freemen, although they
possessed an inherent right to be present, were not in fact represented,
except in so far as the presence of friendly and neighbouring Thegns
might be held to represent them. The power of the Witan was great
and various, being in theory the power of a free nation. They could
elect and discrown a king, and practically did elect him, though
usually from among the nearest relatives of the late king. A remnant
of this elective form of the monarchy still exists in our form of
coronation. Peace and war were discussed in the Witan. The
co-operation of the Witan was necessary to authorize alienation of
public land; and to them ultimate judicial appeals were made.
Early in the eleventh century, however, the king had so far improved
his position that he was able to grant land without their
leave, and also to call to his court cases not yet completed
in the lower courts. The same change in the character of
the king, which has been already mentioned, shows itself here also. He
was originally the leader of a free tribe, perhaps of a clan, but gradually
as his dominion extended his power rose also; and his personal influence,
though somewhat undefined, was paramount. The great king
could always wield the Witan as he pleased. His office was, as has
been said, elective, but under certain restrictions. It seems to have been
regarded as necessary that he should be an Ætheling (or born in legitimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
wedlock), and in England. With this limit, and with a certain
preference allowed to the eldest son, and to the one whom the dying
king nominated, the choice of the Witan was free; and, practically,
the prince of the royal house best fitted for the immediate circumstances
of the kingdom was chosen. Thus the king’s brother was
sometimes chosen instead of his son, who, in his turn, might succeed
his uncle to the exclusion of his uncle’s children. This preference for
the best man over the nearest relative continued after the Conquest, and
renders erroneous the appellation of usurper when applied to the early
Norman kings. The arrangements of finance, as far as
they can be understood, were very simple. Upon every
citizen, whether agricultural or urban, there was laid a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trinoda
necessitas</i>, that is to say, the duty of serving in war, the repair of
bridges and public roads, and the maintenance of fortifications. It
is plain, therefore, that the wants of the crown were chiefly personal,
that what we consider the chief expenses of government, justice,
maintenance of public works, and military expenditure, were supported
by the people themselves, without the interposition of government.
The expenses of the crown would be discharged very largely
from the public property or folcland reserved to the nation, and from
such taxes as were rendered necessary from time to time to support
the grandeur and hospitality of the king as national representative.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Police.</div>

<p>The system of police was based on the idea of mutual responsibility.
Frankpledge or <em>frithbohr</em>, by which is meant the division
of the country into sections of ten men mutually responsible
for one another, cannot be proved to have existed before the Conquest.
On the other hand, its principle no doubt existed. Every man,
by the law of Cnut, was bound to be in a Hundred and a <em>tithing</em>.
This latter term cannot be accurately defined, but it was a subdivision
of the Hundred. By the laws of Æthelstan and Eadgar every landless
man was compelled to have a lord to answer for him in the courts,
and every man a surety to answer for him if he were absent when
legally required.</p>

<p>From this sketch it will be seen that, with regard to classes, there
must have been at the time of the Conquest <em>Thegns</em>, who were to all
intents and purposes feudal barons; <em>Sokmen</em>, those freemen who
owed suit to the lord’s soke or court; a certain number of <em>Eorls</em> or
nobles by birth, who would most likely have become assimilated to
the Thegns; <em>freeholders</em>, holding land in common where it had not
yet come under the suzerainty of a lord (this same class of freemen
degenerated under various circumstances and with varying tenures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
into villeins, or dependent cultivators, under lords); and absolute
slaves, consisting originally probably of the conquered race, and
added to by criminals and outlaws, or others who had lost their rights
as freemen.</p>

<p>There was here every element of the feudal system. Even the
tenure of land upon military service existed. The main distinction
between the condition of England and that of the Continent, where
the feudal system had been fully established, lay in this,&mdash;there still
existed a certain number of freemen whose land was their own. They
were indeed obliged to acknowledge the jurisdiction of a lord, but
they were free to choose their own lord. They were suitors to his
court, but he did not possess their land. The feudal system in its
completed form may be regarded as exhibiting two peculiar features:&mdash;jurisdiction
was in the hand of large landowners; and the lord was
regarded as the possessor of the land over which he exercised jurisdiction.
In England, one feature alone had become prominent. The
judicial power was in the hand of large landowners; but their jurisdiction
extended over men whose land they did not possess, but who
were owners of their own property, and able to attach themselves to
any lord they liked. With the Conquest, while the judicial power
was restrained, the connection between that power and the possession
of land over which it was exercised became absolute.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Church.</div>

<p>The Church occupied a position of very great importance. It was
the guardian of the morality of the country, and as such
had a share in all secular jurisdictions; but it was the
remnant of a national Church, not closely united to the Roman See.
It was therefore inclined to be somewhat disorderly. Its bishops were
appointed properly by the king and the Witan, but latterly the power
had practically been with the king alone. These bishops obtained
their license from the Pope. But the case of Archbishop Stigand, to
whom the Pope had not sent the Pallium, shows how little weight
was given to this proceeding. Similarly, the lower clergy had formed
the habit of marrying, contrary to Papal laws, and although there was
a growing feeling that this was wrong, the practice still continued
while the monks were constantly attempting to break free from their
rules and establish themselves as canons.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Effects of the
Conquest.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Restraints upon
feudalism.</div>
</div>

<p>To such a civilization came William, who had seen the evils of
Continental feudalism in his own country, and had
secured his position only after long struggles. He
claimed England, not as a conqueror, but as the legitimate sovereign,
nominated by Edward the Confessor, and as such was accepted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the Witan, and crowned in London after the battle of Senlac. His
natural policy was, therefore, to continue such institutions as were
not yet feudal, and thus his arrival checked that natural growth
of feudalism which was running its course in England as in other
Teutonic countries. On the other hand, it was impossible from
his position that he should do otherwise than introduce many
feudal institutions. He had brought with him many of his vassals,
who held from him in feudal tenure; and it was necessary, when,
from the confiscated lands of Harold and his family and of the
other nobles who either opposed his entrance into England or
afterwards revolted against him, he made large grants to reward the
adventurers of whom his army mainly consisted, he should make
those grants in accordance with the system with which he was
acquainted in exchange for military service, and saddled with the
usual feudal burdens. While he thus, on the one hand, was the
national English sovereign, on the other he was the supreme landowner
and feudal lord. Under this double influence, the tenure of
land, following the universal tendency of Europe, became wholly
feudal and military. But the other side of feudalism&mdash;with its
isolation, the virtual independence of the feudatories (among whom
the king was but the first among his peers), and the suppression of
national jurisdiction, which were the chief characteristics of French
feudalism&mdash;was kept in careful restraint. Thus, the whole machinery
of justice, the Hundred Court and the Shire Gemot were retained
under presidency of the sheriff, side by side with that territorial
jurisdiction which he could not refuse to his feudal vassals. The
police system of mutual responsibility was kept up and systematized
under the name of <em>frankpledge</em>, and on the whole nation still lay
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trinoda necessitas</i>. The Witan remained, although its members
were now feudal vassals; the laws as they existed were for the most
part perpetuated, though certain emendations were made, such as
the law of Englishry,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> for the protection of his Norman subjects, and
the liberty allowed to the different nationalities to be tried according
to their own law. At the same time, the further to restrain the
independent power of the great feudatories, the great
earldoms which Cnut had created were broken up, with
the exception of three border counties, Chester, Durham, and Kent;
the business of the counties was transacted by the sheriff, who was a
royal officer, and the earldoms were either of one county only, or if
of more than one, of counties far apart. As a final court of appeal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
he established the Curia Regis, formed of the Justiciary (who was
the king’s representative and regent when he left the country), with
a staff of justices, consisting originally of the officers of the household,
but tending gradually to consist of new nobility appointed by the king
for the purpose. This was the final court of appeal, and could draw
to it any suit from the county court. But the chief restriction upon
military feudalism, which rendered its appearance in England impossible,
was, that each freeholder swore allegiance, not to his immediate
lord, but to the king. Abroad, if a great noble went to war with the
king, his vassals were doing right in following him; in England, they
were committing treason.</p>

<div class="sidenote">William’s
position.</div>

<p>This oath was exacted after the great work of the Domesday Book
was completed. This book consisted of a registration of all the
lands in the kingdom, made by commissioners, after inquiry upon
oath of the chief men and lesser freeholders of each district. By
it not only were the limits of property settled, but the king knew
what resources he could rely upon both in men and money. The
king’s power was nominally limited by the “counsel and consent” of
the National Council, which was at once the old English Witan
and a feudal assembly, but its power was really nominal. The
taxes seldom called for interference, as they were derived principally
either from the old national dues, the <em>ferm</em> of the shire (a fixed rent
of the old public lands and royal domains), the danegelt, and the
proceeds of fines or feudal aids. The army was also completely in
the king’s hands; as national sovereign, the old national militia was
at his command; as feudal sovereign, he could claim the military
service of his vassals, which was defined in every case by the
Domesday Book, while the whole people were bound to
him by oath. We thus see William the Conqueror
occupying the position of a practically irresponsible monarch, with
a mixed monarchy of national and feudal character, but, with the
exception of some parts of the administration of justice, carried on
wholly under feudal forms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Church.</div>

<p>As regards the Church, two important changes were made. As
the champion of orthodoxy, William, by means of his
Archbishop, Lanfranc, restored the Roman discipline to
the Church, and connected it closely with the See of Rome. And,
secondly, he separated the ecclesiastical jurisdiction from the secular.
The bishops withdrew from the county court (perhaps finding their
position there useless now that those courts had sunk in importance),
and established courts of their own. During William’s reign no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
inconvenience arose from this, but the inherent defects of the step
became obvious when Henry II. attempted to reorganize the kingdom
after the disorder of Stephen’s reign. The Conqueror’s police was
unusually strict. It became the common saying that a man laden
with gold could pass unharmed through the country. He abolished
the penalty of death (which was, however, speedily resumed), and
substituted mutilations of various kinds. He also repressed the
right which the Saxon laws had allowed of killing the murderer
or the thief when taken red-handed. It has been suggested that
the great forests he created, and the care with which they were
maintained, is to be attributed as much to the king’s desire to
maintain an efficient staff of police always ready as to his great love
of hunting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intended
resistance of
the English.<br /><br />
Election of
Eadgar.</div>

<p class="drop-cap">The death of Harold left England without a king. As yet,
although William had expected the immediate submission of
the whole country, no such course was thought of. The idea
which occupied men’s minds was the election of a new
king, who might continue the defence of the country.
The two sons of Ælfgar, the great northern Earls
Edwin and Morkere, whose jealousy of Harold had been one of
the chief causes of his disaster, found themselves, now that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
House of Godwine was practically destroyed, the most prominent
leaders of the English. They came to London, and there, collecting
about them such nobles and important people as they could readily
find, they held an assembly which in some sort represented the
Witan. They probably expected that the crown would be given to
one of themselves, and that the hour for the triumph of the Mercian
house had arrived. They were disappointed in their hopes. Of
properly qualified candidates there were none, but the Southern
Witan preferred to place the crown upon the head of
the grandson of Ironside, the heir of the old royal
house, and elected the Ætheling Eadgar, young though he was.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It
does not seem however that he was actually crowned, that ceremony
being postponed till the feast of Christmas.</p>

<p>After the slaughters of the late battles, the means of resistance in
the Southern counties must have been much diminished, and when
Edwin and Morkere completed their treasonable conduct by again
withdrawing their troops, and, though they had accepted the election,
refused to give practical support to the defence of Wessex, immediate
opposition to the Conqueror became hopeless. No further combined
action was possible and no other great battle was fought.</p>

</div>

<p>Meanwhile William, disappointed in his hopes, proceeded with his
own foreign forces to make good his conquest. He
determined to subdue the South-eastern counties before
he advanced against London. He marched eastward, took Romney,
and captured the castle and town of Dover, and had reached
Canterbury, when he was seized with an illness which kept him
inactive during the whole month of November. Thence he sent an
embassy which secured the great town of Winchester, and thence in
December he moved to attack the capital, but contented himself
with burning the suburb of Southwark, and passed on westward on
the southern side of the Thames, which he did not cross till he
reached Wallingford, intending to pass northward and thus cut the
city off from the unconquered country. With this view he marched
to Berkhampstead in Hertfordshire. But his progress had
broken the spirit of the Londoners, and he was there
met by Eadgar, Ealdred the Archbishop of York, and
others, who submitted to him, and offered him the crown. After
a feigned rejection of it, till he had further secured the kingdom, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
accepted it at the earnest request of his followers, and marching into
London, was crowned at Christmas. The ceremony
was performed by Ealdred of York in the place of
Stigand of Canterbury, whose appointment to the See had not been
strictly canonical; it was impossible that William, one of whose
professed objects was the reform of the uncanonical Church of
England, should receive his crown from the hands of a schismatic.
Stigand’s importance as the chief official of the English prevented
William from taking immediate steps against him. He was therefore
present at the ceremony, but though William thus, and for some
time afterwards, temporized with him, his ruin was already determined.
The coronation was performed with the usual English
ceremonies; the name of the King was proposed for election to those
who were present, and the shout of acquiescence excited the alarm
of the Norman troops outside the church. They proceeded to set
fire to buildings in the neighbourhood; the assembled multitude
rushed from the church to extinguish the flames, and William was
left almost alone with the officiating ecclesiastics. But the ceremony
was completed in the midst of fears and misgivings of those within
the Cathedral, and of uproar and confusion without.</p>

<div class="sidenote">William’s
position
as king.</div>

<p>William was thus crowned King of England, having received the
crown from the hands of the Witan, and having been
nominally elected by the popular voice. His position
was in strict accordance with the claims he had raised, and he
proceeded to pursue a policy in harmony with it. He had come to
claim his rights against a usurper, he had obtained those rights, and
would henceforth make them good while strictly following the forms
of law. As crowned King of England, opposition to him was
treasonable, and the property of traitors legally confiscated. It is
clear that this position gave him great advantages, and would induce
many a weak-hearted or peaceful Englishman to accept without
opposition the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</i> king, while it enabled William to hide the
harsh character of the conqueror under the milder form of a monarch
at war with rebellious subjects.</p>

<p>In pursuance of this policy, no sudden change was made in the
constitution or social arrangements of the country. In the first
period of his rule, William merely stepped into the place and
exercised the rights of his predecessor; but those rights he found
sufficient to secure his own position and to reward his followers.
For these purposes it was necessary for him to give to Normans
much of the conquered land, by which means he would spread as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
were a garrison throughout the country, and at the same time
gratify his adherents.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Transfer of

<p>He started from the legal fiction that the whole of the land, as
the land of traitors, was confiscated. The folcland he
made crown property, thus completing a change which
had been long in progress. The large domains of the
House of Godwine were by the destruction of that house
naturally at his disposal, as was also the property of those who had
fallen in arms against him at Hastings or been prominent in opposition.
The land thus gained he granted to his followers, not making a new
partition of it, but putting a Norman in the place of the dead or outlawed
Englishman who was legally regarded as his ancestor. To complete
this process, and appropriate all the conquered land, would obviously
have been impolitic; and very shortly after his coronation he appears to
have allowed a general redemption of property. Proprietors submitted,
paid a sum of money, and received their lands back as fresh grants
from the Conqueror. In addition to this, many of the smaller
Thegns and free Ceorls were too insignificant to be disturbed, and
in many instances some little fragment of their dead husband’s
property was given in contemptuous pity to the widows, saddled
frequently with some ignoble tenure. Still further to
complete the subjection of the country, in every conquered
town of importance a castle was erected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Appointment
of Earls.</div>

<p>In addition to his grants of land, William had the government of
the country to attend to, and the vacant earldoms to
fill. In doing this he was guided by his past experience,
and in the fully conquered parts of England was careful not
to put any earl into the position occupied by the great earls of the
last days of the Anglo-Saxon monarchy. In this respect, as in some
others, the spirit of feudalism had been making rapid strides in
England, and the great earls, as well as the great cities, were bidding
fair to assume the position of the feudatories and free cities of
the Continent. William was careful to return to older precedent,
and to confine his earldoms to one shire. The importance of this
in English history is great, as it obliged the nobility to work
in alliance with the commonalty, and secured national rather than
aristocratic progress. Thus his two most trusted servants, to whom
in his absence he left the vice-regency of the kingdom, William
Fitz-Osbern and his brother Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, were respectively
but Earls of Hereford and of Kent. William thus arranged that
part of England which he had really conquered. In the North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
he as yet continued the existing state of things. Edwin and Morkere
did homage and received their Earldoms back again. Waltheof
remained Earl of Nottingham, and Copsige (Copsi or Coxo) was
given the earldom of the Northern province of Northumberland.
To secure the allegiance of these great unconquered Earls, William
took them with him when in March he went to revisit his native
duchy. The kingdom he left in charge, the South to Odo of
Bayeux, the North to William Fitz-Osbern.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">William revisits

<div class="sidenotex">Misgovernment
by his viceroys
and consequent
rebellion.</div>
</div>

<p>His retirement from England has sometimes been traced to an evil
intention of enticing his new subjects into a more
serious rebellion, that he might conquer them more
completely. His natural desire to display his triumph in his own
country would seem to supply a sufficient reason, without attributing
to him such double dealing. The effect of his absence, however,
was in fact to produce such an insurrection. In the
midst of his conquests and confiscations he had always
kept a strong hand upon his followers, and his police
was good. The case was different under the government
of his viceroys. The rapacity and licentiousness of the conquerors
made itself heavily felt. Discontent began to show itself in the
North, in the West, and in the South; and the native English,
despairing of their unaided efforts, began to seek assistance from
abroad. The news of this danger brought William back to England
in the December of 1067. But already a revolt in Bernicia, as the
Northern division of Northumberland was called, had produced the
death of the newly-made Earl Copsige. Eadric the Forester in the
West of England, in union with the Welsh, had ravaged Herefordshire,
and the men of Kent had obtained assistance from Eustace
of Boulogne in a fruitless attack upon Dover. It was the dread of
more important foreign allies which brought William back. The
English efforts to get aid from Henry IV. of Germany, or from
the Prince of Norway, had been frustrated either by William’s
intrigues or by the character of the Princes to whom they applied,
but Swend of Denmark seemed likely to embrace their cause.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">William
returns.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Insurrection
in the West.
Taking of
Exeter.</div>
</div>

<p>On his return, William found that although his lieutenants had
repressed actual insurrections, the unconquered districts
both of the North and West of England were gloomy
and threatening. Want of union was still the bane of the English;
the insurrection of Exeter and the West had been suppressed before
York and the North moved. The party of Harold and his family
was strong in Exeter and the Western shires. At Exeter, indeed, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
is probable that what remained of the family of Godwine was
at this time collected. William marched against the
city, harrying Dorset as he passed. The position of
Exeter was characteristic. As in the case of the great
earldoms, so in that of the great cities, the feeling of
local independence had been rising, and the chief men of Exeter seem
to have had some thought of making their city a free town. They
offered to own the King’s supremacy and to pay his taxes, but refused
to admit him within their walls. The one point of William’s
policy which is most prominent is his determination to establish
the strength of the monarchy, as against local interests. He
therefore rejected the proposition, and marched upon the city. The
civic chiefs offered to submit, but the people repudiated their
arrangements, and stood the siege. The city was captured by means
of a mine. Harold’s family fled&mdash;Gytha, his mother, to the islands
in the Bristol Channel, his sons to Ireland. As usual, a castle was
built in the city; the tribute of the town considerably increased;
both Devonshire and Cornwall completely subdued, and the same
process of partial confiscation which had marked the first steps of the
Conqueror carried out there. The earldom of Cornwall, and a large
quantity of property, was given to Robert of Mortain, William’s
half-brother. The conquest of the West was completed by the
subjugation of Gloucestershire and Worcestershire.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Insurrection in
the North.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">William’s
position in
the North and
West.</div>
</div>

<p>This insurrection was hardly over when a general confederation
against the Conqueror was set on foot in the North.
Edwin and Morkere, and Eadgar, the nominal king,
combined with Eadric the Forester, and had good hopes of assistance
from the Welsh, from Malcolm Canmore of Scotland, and from Swend
of Denmark. This help was not forthcoming; civil war hindered the
Welsh, and Malcolm and Swend were not ready. The feeling
against the Normans was, however, very strong, many of the
inhabitants of Yorkshire taking to the woods rather than submit.
The insurrection was a failure. Again Edwin and Morkere showed
complete want of energy, submitted, and were received into favour.
Such a desertion destroyed all unity of action; their armies dispersed
to their own homes. A certain number of the insurgents
retired and held Durham, others took refuge in Scotland,
but William found no opposition; York submitted,
and the usual castle, the constant badge of conquest,
was built there. On his homeward march through
Lincolnshire, the town of Lincoln and that part of England was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
also subjugated, while, at the same time, Malcolm of Scotland sent
an embassy, and commended himself to William. At the close of 1068
William was actual possessor of England as far northward as the
Tees; but Cheshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, and part of Herefordshire
were still unconquered; Durham, Northumberland, and
Scotland were his only by the tie of homage.</p>

<p>At this time it is said that a considerable number of his Norman
followers, disliking to leave their homes so long, returned to Normandy,
throwing up their estates in England. This movement has
been exaggerated, as Hugh de Grantmesnil, who is mentioned as the
leader of the returning Normans, undoubtedly held property in England
afterwards. It is, however, probable that some returned, for
William at this time discharged many of his mercenaries, acting
henceforward more completely as English king.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Revolt in the
North.</div>

<p>At the midwinter meeting of the Witan he proceeded to act as
though the North was completely conquered, and granted
the earldom of Northumberland, vacant by the flight
of Gospatric, to his follower Robert de Comines. But the reception
of this new earl showed how unsubdued as yet the northern earldom
was. He reached Durham, and was received by the Bishop Æthelwine;
but when his troops treated the city as though they had
conquered it, the inhabitants rose and put him and his men to
death. The spirit of insurrection spread, and the citizens of York
at once also rose and slew one of the commanders there, Robert Fitz-Richard.
This blow, which seems to have been concerted, was immediately
followed by the return of Eadgar and the other exiles
from Scotland. William hurried thither in person, re-established his
authority, and built a second castle, which he put into the hands of
William Fitz-Osbern. He then withdrew into the West of England,
conscious probably that the Northern insurrection was only one of
his dangers, for Swend of Denmark had at length sent a fleet to the
assistance of the English, the sons of Harold were landing in Devonshire,
and Eadric the Wild was threatening the north-west of his
dominions. In fact, we have in this year the great final struggle of
the English, and the Norman dominions were assaulted upon all
sides.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">William’s

<div class="sidenotex">Complete
subjugation

1070</div>
</div>

<p>As usual, however, the want of proper concert and of any acknowledged
and heroic leader rendered the English efforts
futile. The sons of Harold were disastrously defeated
by Count Brian of Brittany, their wandering and ill-disciplined
troops conquered in two battles in one day, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
themselves, escaping to Ireland, are heard of no more. This was in
July. In September the Danish fleet approached. It touched, but
was beaten off, both in Kent and in East Anglia, and finally entered
the Humber, where it was joined by the great English exiles.
Thence the combined English and Danish army moved upon York,
while Eadric, in Staffordshire and the Welsh border, moved forward
and besieged Shrewsbury, and the men of the West, though unaided
by the sons of Harold, rose and besieged the castle of Montacute in
Somersetshire. These two lesser insurrections William could afford
to leave to his lieutenants; Bishop Geoffrey of Coutances relieved
Montacute, and William Fitz-Osbern and Earl Brian apparently
completed the subjugation of the West, compelling Eadric the
Forester to retire after he had destroyed Shrewsbury, and re-establishing
the Norman influence in Devonshire. William himself
hastened to the scene of greatest danger. Already the castles of
York were taken, as the story tells us chiefly by the prowess of
Waltheof; but having completed this object the army had foolishly
dispersed, and the Danes, lying in the Humber, were occupying
Lindesey and the north of Lincolnshire. There William’s sudden
march surprised them, and they were compelled to withdraw to the
other side of the Humber. William then set quietly to work, with
his army, which had now joined him, at the reconquest
of Yorkshire. Staffordshire and Nottingham were
secured, and after a lengthened delay at the passage of
the Aire, during which he was probably engaged in negotiations with
the Danes, he moved on practically unopposed to York. He there
re-established his two castles, and proceeded to give the inhabitants of
the country a lesson they were not likely to forget. He set to work
systematically to lay waste the whole of the territory from the
Humber to the Tees. Every house, every store of food, the very
cattle themselves were included in the great burning. The completeness
of the destruction is marked by the entries of “Waste,” following
each other in unbroken succession in the Domesday Book. For nine
years the country was left untilled, the towns wholly uninhabited,
and the few survivors lived like beasts of the field, feeding upon unclean
animals, and reduced even, in their utter want, to eat human
flesh. Having completed this terrible work, William
kept his Christmas in state at York. He pursued his
advantage further, and, as the winter went on, advanced
and secured the hitherto unconquered town of Durham.
The North of England was at length completely conquered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>But the North-west, the counties of Cheshire and Shropshire, was
still unsubdued, and in the dead of the winter William made his
way, in the midst of unspeakable difficulties, through the wild moorland
and hill country which joins the Peak district with the higher
mountains of the Pennine range. The conquest of Chester, and the
ravaging of the neighbouring counties, completed his work. And
when, early in the year Osbern, the commander of Swend’s fleet,
yielding to the diplomacy and bribes of William, sailed away to his
own land, the conquest of England may be said to have been finished.</p>

<div class="sidenote">William’s
legislation.</div>

<p>For the moment free from military difficulties, William proceeded
to the regulation of his Conquest. He is said now to
have re-enacted the laws of Edward, and although it is
probably a legend that he issued a complete code of laws, it is likely
that he took the opportunity of declaring the re-enactment of existing
laws, with such changes as he chose to introduce. Two ordinances
which seem to belong to this period exist. One, ordaining that peace
and security should be kept between English and Normans, and the
laws of Edward, with regard to land and other matters, upheld, with
the addition of such as the King had added for the advantage of the
English people. The second, enacting a heavy fine for the death of
any one of his soldiers, which fine is to be made good by the Hundred
in which the murder was committed; this was for the defence of his
troops against lawless patriotism, and grew into the law of Englishry,
by which an unknown corpse was always presumed to be that of a
Frenchman, and the fine inflicted, unless the English nationality of
the murdered man was proved.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">His reform of
the Church.
Appointment of
foreign Bishops.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Stigand
deposed.</div>
</div>

<p>But William had always kept before him, as an object, the change
and reform of the English Church, which till this time
had been strictly national, its laws having been enacted
by the mixed secular and ecclesiastical Witan, and the
bishop having presided side by side with the secular
judges in the shire gemot. The intention of William, whose enterprise
had been undertaken with the full concurrence of the Roman
See, whose interests he, as well as the Normans of Sicily, had much at
heart, was to Romanize this national Church. For carrying out that
scheme he looked to the gradual displacement of bishops of English
birth, whose places could be filled with foreigners. This connection
with Rome is marked by the re-coronation of the King in 1070 by
the Papal Legates, immediately after which the attack
upon the English Church began. The Primate Stigand
was the first victim. With him the King had hitherto temporized;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
when he was charged with holding the See of Winchester with
his own archbishopric, with having obtained the Pallium from the
false Pope Benedict X., and with having accepted his bishopric during
the lifetime of his predecessor Robert. He was deprived of both his
bishoprics, and kept a prisoner at Winchester. His brother Æthelmær
was removed from the bishopric of the East Angles. Æthelwine
of Durham was also deprived and outlawed, and Ethelric,
Bishop of Selsey, deposed. The Archbishopric of York, too, was
vacant by the death of Ealdred, so that William had here a good
opportunity for carrying out his plans.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Lanfranc made
Archbishop.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Lanfranc’s
legislation
connects the
Church with
Rome.</div>
</div>

<p>The most important appointments were the two archbishoprics.
For his new Primate he selected Lanfranc, an Italian
priest, at this time Abbot of the little monastery at Bec,
whose learning and importance were such that he had already been
offered and had refused the Primacy of Normandy. It was not without
much show of opposition on his part that he accepted the Archbishopric
of Canterbury; but, when once appointed, he proved himself
a most efficient instrument in carrying out the plans of the King.
To the other vacant bishoprics, in almost every case, chaplains of
the King were appointed. The changes thus begun were carried
out gradually during the whole reign, and were in fact an offshoot
of the great movement for the revival of the Papacy
being carried out in Europe by Hildebrand. Having
first, for the purposes of centralization, established the
supremacy of the See of Canterbury over that of York, Lanfranc
set on foot the habit of holding separate ecclesiastical councils after
the great National Meetings had been dissolved; the bishops withdrew
from the county court, and established ecclesiastical courts of
their own; as far as possible regular canons were put in the place of
the secular canons, of whom many of the chapters consisted; and
although the archbishop had sufficient sense to tolerate those of the
clergy who were already married, for the future such marriages were
strictly prohibited.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">But William
still head of
the Church.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">The change
good on the
whole.</div>
</div>

<p>The effect of such legislation was to separate the clergy from the
laity, and to connect the Church much more nearly with Rome.
This policy, which in after times was the source of so much evil, was
rendered harmless during the reign of William by his great power and
decision. He always claimed the position of supreme
head of the Church in England, nor would he suffer any
encroachments from the Papal See. On more than one
occasion he exhibited this determination. To the end of his reign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
he insisted upon giving the ring and staff to his bishops. He would
not allow any of his soldiers to be excommunicated without his leave,
and when Hildebrand, occupying the Papal throne as Gregory VII.,
demanded that he should both pay Peter’s pence and declare himself
the Pope’s man, he replied, the money he would pay, as his predecessors
had, that the homage he would refuse, as he had neither himself
promised it, nor had his predecessors paid it. In many respects the
change was doubtless for the better. The bishops were
on the whole more learned men, and education was improved.
The spirit of self-denial for the sake of the
Church, and the consequent establishment of foundations and cathedrals,
was revived, and the Church, brought into better discipline,
was more able to play its proper part of mediator and peace-maker in
an age of violence. The distribution of patronage was not, however,
without its dark side. In many instances ecclesiastical position was
given in reward of services to men qualified rather to be soldiers than
clergymen; and complaints exist of the tyrannical manner in which
these soldier-abbots or bishops behaved to their English inferiors.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">William
conquers him.
1071.</div>
</div>

<p>The conquest of England was completed, as we have seen, in 1070.
But it was six years more before William enjoyed the throne
in peace. The remnant of the conquered nation gathered around
a national hero, called Hereward, in the Fen country.
His origin is not certain, but he seems to have been a
Lincolnshire man who had been deprived of his property
by a Norman intruder. He first appears as assailing
with a host of outlaws the monastery of Peterborough, where one
of those soldier abbots just mentioned, Turold by name, had been
lately appointed. He is next heard of when, in 1071, the Earls
Edwin and Morkere, who had seen the destruction of their old
earldoms, while living in inglorious ease, half prisoners half guests
at the Norman court, at length awoke from their lethargy and
attempted to renew the war. Edwin was killed as he fled, stopped
by the flooding of some river; Morkere succeeded in joining the
insurgents at Ely. Hereward’s fastness was known by the name of
the Camp of Refuge. There were collected many of the noblest of
the old English exiles; and legend speaks of the presence of several
people who were undoubtedly not there; but, at all events, Æthelwine,
the deposed Bishop of Durham, was with the patriots.</p>

<p>The attack was intrusted to William of Warenne, Earl of Surrey,
and Ivo of Taillebois, under the superintendence of William himself,
who came to Cambridge. The difficulties of the situation were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
overcome by the building of a great causeway across the fens. The
defence of the camp is described as lengthened and heroic,
but before the end of the year it seems to have been
captured, and Morkere and Æthelwine both prisoners.
Hereward himself escaped, and in 1073 is mentioned as leading the
English contingent in William’s attack on Maine. The legend
describes how, while living in peace with the king, he was surprised
at his meals by a band of Normans, and after a terrific combat, in
which he slew fifteen or sixteen Frenchmen, was finally overpowered
by numbers. In sober fact, his end seems to have been peaceful,
as he appears in Domesday Book as holding property both in Worcester
and Warwick.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wales held in
check by the
Earls of Chester
and Shrewsbury.</div>

<p>From the English William had no further trouble; with the
neighbouring kingdoms he had still some difficulties.
With the Britons in Wales, the old Earls of Mercia
and the house of Leofric had had friendly connection;
but all sign of this had ceased upon the Conquest. The wars
carried on against them were however local in character; for,
contrary to his usual practice, William had established upon the
West March two palatine counties of Chester and Shrewsbury. In
these counties the whole of the land belonged to the earl and his
tenants, and the king had no domain. They were, therefore, like
the great feudal holdings of France. Chester he at first placed in
the hands of Gerbod the Fleming, his stepson, and, upon his withdrawal
to the Continent, in those of Hugh of Avranches, surnamed
Lupus, a man of whom the chroniclers speak much evil as at once
licentious and tyrannical. Together with his lieutenant, Robert of
Rhuddlan, he waged continual war with the Welsh. The same task
fell to Roger of Montgomery, Earl of Shrewsbury, who took advantage
of the disputes among the Welsh Princes, and succeeded so far as
to build and hold, far in Wales, the castle of Montgomery, called after
his own property in the neighbourhood of Lisieux in Normandy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scotland’s
savage invasions.</div>

<p>Malcolm Canmore had throughout appeared as the supporter of the
conquered English, and at his court the exiles had been
constantly received. This did not prevent him from
pushing his ravages into the Northern counties; nor
did they cease when he received Eadgar Ætheling and his sisters on
their flight to the North (1070). This was followed by acts of
extraordinary barbarity. Gospatric, who had found favour with
William, and accepted the Earldom of Northumberland, attempted a
counter invasion into the Scotch district of Cumberland. In rage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
at this Malcolm gave orders to spare neither sex nor age. The old
and the infants were slaughtered, the able-bodied men and maidens
were carried off into slavery, so that there were few Scotch villages
where there were not English slaves. Malcolm, however, grew
milder under the influence of his wife Margaret, Eadgar’s sister, and
the effect of the presence of the numerous English, either refugees
or slaves, was such that the Lowlands became thoroughly Anglicised.</p>

<div class="sidenote">William makes

1072.</div>

<p>In 1072, William himself revenged the inroad of the year 1070,
by marching into Scotland and receiving the oath of
fealty of Malcolm at Abernethy on the Tay. It is
mentioned that the last great noble who had held out
against him, Eadric the Wild, accompanied him on this expedition,
which marks not only the Conquest of England, but the
assumption on the part of William of that Imperial position in Great
Britain which the great English kings had held.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Trouble in
Normandy.
1075.</div>

<p>His foreign neighbours also gave William some trouble. The
province of Maine, which he had conquered in 1063,
threw off his allegiance. The citizens of Le Mans had
risen in insurrection against their lords, and formed
themselves into a free commune; but Geoffrey of Mayenne, a nobleman
whose help they had sought, betrayed the burghers in their
efforts to reduce one of the neighbouring nobility, and they were
obliged to call in the assistance of Fulk of Anjou, who had claims upon
the province. William reduced Le Mans, but was obliged to make
a peace with Fulk, who had strengthened himself by an alliance with
the Bretons; and, by the treaty of Blanchelande, William’s son
Robert took the government of Maine, but did homage for it to
Anjou.</p>

</div>

<p>While affairs on the Continent were thus occupying his attention,
in 1075 a conspiracy of his own nobles in England broke
out. Ralph of Gwader (or Wader), the son of Ralph
the Staller and a Breton lady, had been intrusted with
the Earldom of Norfolk. Roger, the son of William Fitz-Osbern,
had succeeded to the Earldom of Hereford. These two nobles
sought to ally their houses, and, against the will of William, Ralph
married Emma, Roger’s sister. At the bridal feast Waltheof of Nottingham,
the one remaining English Earl, was present, and there a
conspiracy was entered into, apparently on account of the strong hold
which William kept over his nobles, and in the interests of more perfect
feudalism. The kingdom was to be divided among the three
earls, one of whom was to be king. Waltheof had been well treated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
by the King, and married to his niece Judith. His conscience seems
to have pricked him, and he confessed all to Lanfranc, at that time
governing England. The conspiracy was at once suppressed; Norwich
alone, under Emma, the new married bride, made a brave defence.
Ralph fled to Brittany. Roger was taken prisoner, and spent
his life in captivity. Waltheof was at first received into favour, but
afterwards, it is believed at the instigation of his wife, he was tried
before the Witan and found guilty of death. The sentence was
executed in secret outside the town of Winchester. During his imprisonment
the Earl’s penitence had been deep, and it
was while still on his knees uttering the Lord’s Prayer
that the impatient executioner smote off his head. The
national hero, dying in this religious state of mind, speedily became
the national saint. His remains were removed to Crowland, which
he had much benefited, and miracles were worked at his tomb. The
confiscation of the property of these two earldoms, and the death of
Queen Edith, the widow of the Confessor, threw great property into
the hands of William, who did not reappoint to the earldoms.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Quarrels between
William
and his sons.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Reconciliation
at Gerberoi.
1079.</div>
</div>

<p>From this time onward William lived generally in Normandy,
leaving England to the care of Lanfranc and Odo of Bayeux. The
great success of his reign had indeed been reached, and the remaining
years were disturbed by constant disputes with his sons
and with his suzerain the King of France. Already,
when pursuing Ralph of Gwader on his retreat into
Brittany, and besieging him in the town of Dol, he had found
himself checked by the union of Philip of France with Alan Fergant
of Brittany, and had found it advisable to marry his daughter Constance
to that nobleman as the price of peace. So, too, to lessen the
jealousy the King of France might naturally have felt at his vassal’s
great aggrandisement, he had made the Norman barons swear fealty
to his son Robert as his heir, and had caused him to do homage in his
place for Maine. Robert desired to make this nominal position real;
and, as a part of the same feudal movement perhaps which produced
the conspiracy of 1075, he demanded Normandy and Maine of his
father. His demand was refused; and when, during an expedition
of William against the Count of Mortagne, an accidental quarrel arose
between Robert and his brothers, in company with many of the
younger nobility he broke into open rebellion. With these, after an
unsuccessful attempt at Rouen, he fled to Hugh of Neufchâtel.
Beaten thence, he wandered from court to court, assisted by his
mother Matilda, against William’s will. At length he found an ally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
in Philip, who established him in 1079 in Gerberoi, near the borders
of Normandy. It was there that father and son met
face to face, and that William was unhorsed by Robert.
The siege of Gerberoi had to be raised, and William
underwent the humiliation of seeking a reconciliation with his son,
a reconciliation which was of short duration, as in 1080 Robert again
fled from court.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Odo’s oppressive
government.</div>

<p>In all directions ill success was attending William. He had been
defeated at Dol and at Gerberoi; his son Robert in the period between
his two quarrels had failed in an expedition against Scotland; he had
just lost his son Richard in the New Forest; and in 1083 he lost
his wife, to whom he was deeply attached. Meanwhile Odo had been
ruling with extreme severity. In suppressing an insurrection
in Northumberland he had been guilty of
extortion and of cruel punishment even of the innocent. In his
general government he seems to have been extremely avaricious. In
the year 1082 his wealth and pride had risen to such a point that he
thought of attaining to the Papacy. This he intended to secure by
violent means. He purchased a magnificent palace in Rome to win
the favour of the people, and even collected an army, in which Hugh
of Chester took service, to cross the Apennines. William met him
and apprehended him at the Isle of Wight; nor could the complaints
of the Pope, which we cannot conceive to have been very earnest,
produce any effect. He was seized, as the King affirmed, not as
Bishop but as Earl of Kent, and remained in prison till the King’s
death. Odo’s oppressions had been very severe, and the condition of
England no doubt had become much worse since the complete subjugation
of the country, and now, in addition to a famine which had
just wasted the country, a heavy direct tax was laid on all land, and
worse than that, a vast host of foreign mercenaries was quartered on
all the King’s tenants, for a great danger was threatening.</p>

<p>Cnut was on the throne of Denmark. He had been one of the
commanders in Swend’s disastrous expeditions; he had
married Adela the daughter of Robert of Flanders,
one of William’s chief Continental enemies, and had
now determined to invade England. He had induced the King
of Norway to join him, and their combined fleets were expected.
William took ruthless precautions against his enemies. The old tax
of the Danegelt was reimposed, and all the land along the coast was
laid waste. The people were even ordered to shave and change their
dresses, that the Danes might not easily recognize them. Disputes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
among the leaders, and the death of Cnut, prevented the invasion.
But it was probably the difficulties which William had found in collecting
his taxes and troops on this occasion which induced him to set on
foot the great survey which produced the Domesday
Book. For this purpose commissioners were appointed,
who went through England, and in each shire inquired
of the sheriff, priests, reeves, and representatives of the inhabitants,
the condition of the land and its value, as compared with what it
had been in the reign of the Confessor. The whole of this great work
was completed in one year. On its completion a great assembly was
held on Salisbury Plain. It was, in fact, a vast review, attended by
no less than 60,000 persons. In this assembly was passed the important
ordinance which ordered that every man should be not only
the man of his immediate lord, but also the man of the king. This
was in direct opposition to the usual rule in feudal countries. The
whole assembly took the oath to William. This great piece of work,
which rendered England one nation, was a fitting conclusion to
William’s reign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">William’s death
and burial.

<p>In the following year a war broke out for the possession of the
Vexin claimed by the King of France. Angered by a coarse jest of
that monarch, William entered the country and ruthlessly ravaged it,
and at the destruction of the town of Mantes, his horse
stepped upon a burning coal and threw him forward
upon the pummel of the saddle; the bulk of the King
aggravated the injury, which in a few days caused his death.
Before he died he released his prisoners. No sooner had the breath
left his body than his attendants are said to have fled. He owed
his burial not to his son, but to the kind offices of a neighbouring
knight, and when brought to his Church of St. Stephen’s at Caen, it
was not till the clergy had paid the price of the grave that Anselm
Fitz-Arthur, whose property had been seized to make room for the
Church, would allow his body to be buried.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1087.</div>

<p class="drop-cap">While the late King was on his deathbed, he had been induced
to declare his wishes with regard to his kingdoms. In
pursuance, perhaps, of a wise policy, and with the wish to keep
up and increase the nationality of England, he gave his
hereditary dominions to his son Robert, England to his
second son William. He told his son Henry to bide his time, and
gave him £5000 in money.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">William is

<div class="sidenotex">Opposition of

1088.</div>
</div>

<p>William at once hurried to England to secure his succession, and,
winning the support of Lanfranc, was in less than three
weeks crowned by him. At Winchester he found the
King’s treasure, from which he distributed gifts among
the churches in England, and a sum of money for the
poor in every shire. A promise of laws more just and mild than
their forefathers had known, attached the English to him for a time.
Thus supported by the Church and by the conquered people, who
could not but rejoice at the separation of England from Normandy,
it was only the Norman Baronage he had to fear.</p>

<p>In Normandy the character of the new Duke Robert, who was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
mere knight-errant, induced the great nobility to get rid of the royal
garrisons from their castles, and otherwise to establish their feudal
independence. A similar movement was begun in England,
where Odo of Bayeux, liberated at the late King’s
death, had returned to his county of Kent, and now found
himself at the head of a strong party who disliked the separation
of their conquered possessions from their hereditary property.
Among the adherents of the party we find such names as the two
great bishops, Geoffrey of Coutances and William of Durham, Robert,
Count of Mortain, Roger of Montgomery, Earl of Shrewsbury, his son
Robert of Belesme, and Hugh of Grantmesnil, with others. Odo
occupied the castle of Rochester, and against it William led a body of
English, collected by a threat that all who had remained behind
should be proclaimed “nithing,” or worthless. The efforts of the
discontented barons in other parts of England were checked, and
finally the castle of Rochester was captured. Odo of Bayeux and the
Normans of the garrison were allowed to march out, which they did
amid the revilings of the besiegers, and to retire to France. The King
thus secured his position in England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lanfranc dies.
Ralph Flambard
succeeds him.
1089.</div>

<p>He had hitherto been kept in some restraint by the influence of
Lanfranc; but when that prelate died in 1089, his coarse,
licentious, sceptical and avaricious character began to
display itself. His chief minister was Ralph Flambard,
a Churchman, who, like many others, was of low parentage, but
who seems to have recommended himself to William by his skill
as a financier. One of the plans attributed to him was a more
accurate completion of the Domesday survey, and the measurement
of the hides of land there returned. This would have been harmless
enough, but there must have been many other more flagrant exactions,
though very likely covered by some form of law, to account
for the hatred with which he was regarded. Although his office is
not mentioned, he was probably justiciary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">William’s
quarrels with
his brothers
in Normandy.
1090.</div>

<p>While England was groaning under the exactions of this man, so
that “men would rather wish to die, than to live under
his power,” the attention of the King was chiefly engaged
in intrigues with the nobles of Normandy. The easy
character of Duke Robert, and the rising anarchy among
the nobles, afforded abundant opportunity. On one occasion it was
the citizen Conan of Rouen with whom he was in correspondence;
and when this plot was discovered, and Prince Henry, at that time
acting with Duke Robert, had thrown the traitor from the cathedral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
tower, it was a quarrel between Grantmesnil and Curci on the one
side, and Robert of Belesme on the other, which gave him an opportunity
of mixing in the affairs of the duchy. In 1091, however, the
brothers came to an agreement, and a treaty was made at Caen, by
which they engaged that the survivor should succeed to the possessions
of his brother; and meanwhile Eu, Fécamp, Mont S. Michel, Cherbourg,
and some other territories, were given to William, who in return
promised to conquer Maine for Robert. Twelve barons of either
party swore to the observance of this treaty.</p>

</div>

<p>Prince Henry, finding himself completely ignored by this arrangement,
took possession of the rock of St. Michel, and bade
defiance to his brothers. After a siege of some duration
he was driven thence; but in the general anarchy of the duchy he
found a home at Domfront, where the citizens begged
him to be their lord, on the condition that he would not
give them up to any other. It is doubtful whether he could have
kept possession of this strong place, had not William’s attention been
engaged by the affairs of Scotland.</p>

<p>Malcolm had renewed hostilities, and William found it necessary
to march in person against him. His expedition was
not successful. The weather destroyed a fleet which
accompanied it, and, by its inclemency, caused much
loss to his army. His presence, however, was sufficient in some
degree to overawe Malcolm; a compromise was effected; Malcolm
again did homage, and received back certain properties in England
of which he had been deprived, and which were perhaps manors
which had been given him as resting-places when he came to do
homage to his suzerain. At the same time, William turned aside into
the district of Cumberland, which was a dependency of the Scotch
crown. He re-established Carlisle, and filled the county with
peasants brought from the South of England from destroyed villages
in the neighbourhood of Winchester. In this he disregarded the
interests of the Scotch King, the immediate lord of the country, who
therefore complained, and was invited to meet William
at the next assembly at Gloucester. There, on the
refusal of William to do him justice, a new quarrel broke out, and
Malcolm was shortly afterwards killed, while invading England, at
Alnwick, by Mowbray, Earl of Northumberland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Continued war
with Wales.
1094.</div>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Wales, too, fighting was almost perpetual.
Not only did the great Earldoms of Shrewsbury and Chester
increase their borders, but many knights took advantage of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
frequent civil divisions of the Welsh to push westward and set up their
castles. The course of the war had lately been in favour
of the Welsh rather than of the Normans, and in 1095
William thought it necessary to lead an army against
them. His attempt was not successful, nor was a repetition of it two
years later more so. The nature of the ground was too difficult for
the advance of a great army, and William, thus a second time repelled,
had again to trust to the self-interest and courage of individual Norman
settlers. This plan he strengthened by granting to Normans portions of
land as yet unconquered. Thus two members of the house of Montgomery,
brothers of Hugh, Earl of Shrewsbury, Roger and Arnulf, did
homage for lands in Powys and Dyfed, and Hugh de Lacy for lands to
the west of Herefordshire. This guerilla warfare was successful, and
Hugh of Chester was just succeeding in winning back Anglesey, which
had been taken from him, when an invasion of Magnus of Norway
checked for the time the Norman success. The Earl of Shrewsbury,
while assisting Hugh of Chester, lost his life, and was succeeded by
Robert de Belesme, his brother. On the whole, the English frontier
constantly advanced, and the border counties were thronged with
castles either of the great Earls or of individual adventurers.</p>

</div>

<p>Intrigues and irregular fighting had meanwhile been constant in
Normandy. In 1094 King Philip of France had been
called in by Robert, but nothing of importance arose
from this. But it gave rise to a curious act of extortion
on the part of William, who summoned 20,000 men from England,
evidently the old English County Militia, and on their arrival at the
coast dismissed them, taking from them the ten shillings a head,
viaticum, or journey-money, they had received from their counties.
In 1095 a great conspiracy of the nobles in England,
headed by Mowbray of Northumberland, came to light.
Mowbray threw himself into Bamborough castle, which
could not itself be taken, but immediately opposite to it another
castle, called Malvoisin, was raised, and the garrison of this “ill-neighbour”
found means to decoy Mowbray out of his stronghold and to
take him prisoner. The danger which threatened William was thus
got over; while the following year the object of his wishes came
into his hands, when Robert, eager to join a crusade
which had just been preached, pledged Normandy to
him for the sum of £6,666. His new situation as ruler
of Normandy brought William into hostility with the neighbouring
countries, and especially with Maine, where Hélie de la
Fléche made head against him, and, with the assistance of Fulk IV.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of Anjou, succeeded in beating him off from Le Mans. William’s
power was now, in spite of this repulse, very great, and the King of
France, with whom he became involved in war in 1097 on the old
subject of the Vexin, looked with anxiety at the growth of his great
vassal, especially when a close friendship arose between him and the
Duke of Poitiers and Guienne. This conjunction, giving the English
King a grasp of France all round the seaboard, made men believe
that his ambition reached to the throne of France, especially as
Philip had but one son, Louis. The strange death of
William put an end to all such thoughts. He was hunting
in the New Forest, whither he had been warned not
to go, and there met his death; whether by an accidental arrow
from the bow of Walter Tyrrel, or falling forward upon the point of
an arrow as he stooped over his prey, or slain by the hands of some of
those whom his cruelty and avarice had made his implacable enemies,
is uncertain. The flight of his attendants, and the unceremonious
treatment of his corpse, seemed to favour the last supposition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Causes of
William’s inferiority
to his
father.</div>

<p>In spite then of his unamiable character; of the difficulties which
had beset him from his somewhat questionable title;
of the natural impulse towards feudal isolation of his
barons; of troublesome neighbours; and occasional want
of success in his expeditions; Rufus had on the whole succeeded
in his plans, as far as his external circumstances were concerned. It
was in his domestic government, especially with regard to the
Church, that his inferiority to his great father is most obvious.
Unlike the Conqueror, he was unable to see, or if he saw, to care
for the national advantages which sprung from a well-organized
Church. With a similar determination to be a perfect king in
his own dominions, he asserted that opinion by violent acts against
the Church itself, by appointments of the worst description, and by a
life from which all show of decency was banished. As long as Lanfranc
lived, he kept some restraint upon himself, but upon his death
he began to show his real temper.</p>

</div>

<p>It was a critical time in the history of the Church. The quarrel
about investitures was raging in Europe. The skill of
Lanfranc and the power of the Conqueror had, as we
have seen, prevented the quarrel from reaching England during that
King’s reign; and to the end of Gregory’s life, 1085, he had kept up
friendly, even flattering, relations with the English King. When
Henry IV. had, in 1080, raised the Anti-Pope Guibert to the Papal
throne under the name of Clement III., Lanfranc had contrived not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
to commit himself to either party, but, on the whole, it is probable,
that during his life the regular Popes, Victor III. and Urban II., who
succeeded him in 1088, were acknowledged in England. On his
death advantage was taken of the Schism practically to acknowledge
neither Pope, and to leave the abbeys and bishoprics vacant. Indeed,
we are told that it was openly asserted that it was a privilege of the
King of England to acknowledge the Pope or not as he pleased.
Thus for four years the archbishopric was unfilled, along
with several other important ecclesiastical preferments,
and the want of discipline in the Church grew worse and worse.
Ralph Flambard, as administrator of the diocese of Lincoln, was
unlimited in his extortions. The Norman Church dignitaries marched
between lines of armed men to church. The Bishop of Wells demolished
the houses of the canons to build his own palace, and even
the religious and moral scruples of the English monks were laughed
at by their licentious superiors. In 1093 the King fell very ill, and
for the time became repentant and religious; he proceeded
to listen to the wishes of his people and fill up
the vacant appointments. The most important of these
was the archbishopric. For this post he selected Anselm of
Aosta, Abbot of Bec. This man was a Piedmontese, who had been
attracted to Normandy by the fame of Lanfranc, and had entered
the Abbey of Bec under him. Upon Lanfranc’s removal to Caen
he was made Prior, and afterwards Abbot. Both his character and
attainments commanded the veneration of the age; and at the
present time he had been invited by Hugh the Fat, Earl of Chester,
to come over and assist him in establishing a Benedictine abbey at
Chester. For this purpose, and charged with a mission from his
monastery, he was induced much against his will to come to England.
In the first access of the King’s repentance&mdash;after issuing a royal
proclamation promising afresh the freedom of captives, the good laws
of King Edward, and the punishment of evil-doers&mdash;he proceeded so
far to action as to appoint Anselm Archbishop. It was not without
something like actual violence that Anselm was forced
to accept the Episcopal staff. The great importance of
the primacy and Anselm’s view of the King’s character
are well shown by some words that are attributed to him: “England’s
plough is drawn by two supereminent oxen, the King and the
Archbishop of Canterbury.... Of these oxen one is dead, and the
other, fierce as a savage bull, is yoked young to the plough, and in
place of the dead ox you would yoke me a poor feeble old sheep with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the wild bull.” The feeble old sheep, however, was a very decided
ecclesiastic. He insisted at once upon the restoration of the whole of
the lands of the See of Canterbury, more even than Lanfranc had held.
He declared that he would publicly acknowledge Pope Urban. And
when, after his consecration, on his presenting the King with £500
of silver, the King demanded £1000, he withdrew his intended
present and distributed all to the poor. Nor was it as a defender of
ecclesiastical rights that he was pre-eminent. He set himself to check
as far as it was possible the shameless and abominable
vice that was rampant in England. Among other signs
of the degraded licentiousness of the times was the effeminate foppery
of the courtiers. Against their long hair and sharp-peaked shoes the
Archbishop was never weary of inveighing. The King’s absence
from England put an end for a time to the disputes between the
Archbishop and the King, but upon his return Anselm demanded
leave to obtain his pall from Pope Urban. This open acknowledgment
of the Pope William wished to avoid, and at a council, summoned
to consider the matter, the deposition of Anselm appears to
have been suggested. The bishops, creatures of the King, basely
deserted their chief; and the wisdom of the Baronage of England,
under the guidance of Robert, Count of Mellent, who throughout this
and the preceding reign appears as the good adviser to the sons of the
Conqueror, alone saved him from that disgrace. Unable to refuse
Anselm’s wish absolutely, the King contrived to persuade the Pope
to send <em>him</em> the pall, but Anselm stoutly refused to receive it from
secular hands, and ultimately triumphed so far as to be allowed to
take it himself from the high altar of the Cathedral of Canterbury.
For the moment the primate was triumphant, the
cowardly bishops sought his absolution. Bishoprics
which fell vacant were at once filled up. The Irish and Scotch
prelates acknowledged Anselm’s superiority. But William, cunning
and implacable, was not to be thus foiled. If the churchman could
not be touched, the feudal tenant could; and Anselm was accused
of insufficient performance of his duty in supplying military followers
for an expedition into Wales. In 1097, unable to withstand the royal
violence, he left England, and made his way to Rome. He there
was present at two great councils, that of Bari in 1098, where the
orthodox doctrine as to the Holy Ghost was established; and one at
Rome in 1099, where a curse was laid on all laymen who conferred
ecclesiastical investitures and upon all churchmen who received
them. Upon William’s death Anselm returned to England.</p>

had not yet been established, and he was very obviously
a fitter man to be King than his brother Robert, the
slight opposition offered by the treasurer was speedily overruled, and
the Sunday following (August 5, 1100) he was crowned
at Westminster. To secure his position, however, he
found it necessary to conciliate all parties. The Church he won by
the immediate filling of vacant sees, and by the recall of the exiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Anselm. William Giffard, the chancellor of Rufus, was made Bishop
of Winchester; Girard of Hereford, Archbishop of York; while both
Norman and Saxon laity were bound to him by a charter, by which
he laid some constitutional restrictions upon the despotism established
by his father. In that charter he promised to abolish all oppressive
duties, and to confine his demands to his just claims as feudal lord;
rendering the same agreement obligatory on his tenants towards their
vassals. False coining was checked, the right of leaving personal
property by will granted, and the law of King Edward, which meant the
old institutions of the country, re-established. He likewise thought
it well to win the heart of the people by marrying a Princess of English
descent, Matilda, niece of Eadgar Ætheling, daughter of Margaret
and Malcolm of Scotland. Further to show his disapproval of his
brother’s policy, he arrested Ralph Flambard, who, however, found
means to escape to Normandy, and was made Bishop of Lisieux.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His policy.</div>

<p>Henry had thus declared the policy he intended to pursue, the
policy of his father rather than of his brother. He
meant to be at once a friend and master of the Church,
and a national sovereign of the English, a character which became a
prince who had been born in that country. That position implied a
power much more centralized than that of a feudal suzerain; and in
England his chief policy was directed throughout his reign to
upholding his mastery over the Church and over refractory barons
who aimed at more perfect feudalism. He was in heart however a
Norman, and, in pursuit of his objects, did not shrink from using his
English subjects with great severity. Similarly, his chief foreign
difficulties were produced by his wish to win the Duchy of Normandy,
and having won it to rule it in the same masterful spirit
in which he ruled England. We find then in his reign ecclesiastical
disputes, disputes with the feudal barons of both England and
Normandy, wars for the conquest of the duchy, and consequent
complications with his suzerain the King of France. Mixed with
these are stories, chiefly from Saxon sources, of cruel and unjust
exactions and acts of injustice, tolerated, if not ordered, against his
Saxon subjects.</p>

<div class="sn-box">

</div>

<p>His views found supporters in the two sons of that Roger de
Beaumont, to whom his father had left the regency of
Normandy when he first came to England. These were
the two great Earls, Robert, Count of Mellent,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> afterwards Earl
Leicester, and his younger brother Henry, Earl of Warwick, the elder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of whom had received no less than ninety-one manors from the
Conqueror, and was the most influential and wisest statesman of the
day. On the other hand, he was constantly opposed
by his brother Robert, a military prince of the feudal
type, and Robert de Belesme of the House of Montgomery, possessor
of the Earldoms of Alençon in France and of Shrewsbury in England,
and by right of marriage of the county of Ponthieu.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Robert of

<p>Robert heard of his brother’s accession to the throne while on his
journey home from the Holy Land. He had served with credit
throughout the first crusade, especially at Dorylæum and at Ascalon.
He had declined the offer of the crown of Jerusalem, and on his return
home had married Sibylla, the daughter of Geoffrey
of Conversana. He was a man of extravagant and
profligate habits, and speedily squandered the fortune
which his wife had brought him, but the entreaties of English
exiles, and of those discontented nobles who longed for an easier
rule than they could expect from Henry, roused him to assert his
claim to the English crown. Robert of Belesme and his brothers,
Walter Giffard, Robert Malet, Ivo of Grantmesnil, even William of
Warrenne, Earl of Surrey, closely connected with the royal house,
joined his party.</p>

</div>

<p>But the English were true to the King. Fitz-Hamon, Bigot, and
the Earl of Mellent, added their influence to the same side. It was
probably chiefly the talents of Mellent, and the threat of excommunication
from Archbishop Anselm, which brought about a peaceful
solution of the difficulty. A treaty was arranged by which Robert
renounced his claims in exchange for the Cotentin and
3000 marks a year. It was also stipulated that a complete
amnesty should be extended to the partisans of
either prince in his brother’s country. It was not Henry’s intention
however to carry out this part of the stipulation, and no sooner had
Robert left the country than the King proceeded to take steps against
the two leaders of his brother’s faction, Ivo of Grantmesnil and
Robert of Belesme. Ivo had been a crusader, and was
one of those who had fled from the siege of Antioch,
being let down the wall with a rope. He had thus earned the title
among the witty Normans of the “Rope-dancer,” and finding his
credit gone he withdrew from England. His share in the earldom of
Leicester was given to Robert of Mellent, who subsequently acquired
the rest of the earldom. Alarmed by these measures of the King,
William de Warrenne induced Robert foolishly to come over to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
England to negotiate for the safety of his partisans. His position
there was one of great jeopardy, and he was glad to retire, having
renounced his money payment, but having secured the restitution of
William in his Earldom of Surrey, of which he had been deprived.
The withdrawal of Robert from the contest allowed Henry to turn
his undivided attention to the destruction of Robert de Belesme, the
head of the Norman party in England. From him he won the
castles of Nottingham and Tickhill, and subsequently
that of Bridgenorth, to which he had retreated. When
many of the barons combined to seek his pardon, Henry,
still resting on the support of the English, refused to
listen to them, and proceeded to win from him his last stronghold,
the Castle of Shrewsbury. Upon this Belesme withdrew with his
two brothers into Normandy, and the disaffection of the aristocracy
was permanently checked.</p>

</div>

<p>It had been stipulated that the brothers should not receive each
other’s exiles. In spite of this Robert of Normandy,
enraged at the persecution of his partisans, restored to
Belesme his continental property. Henry consequently
on his side continued his measures against Robert’s
partisans. He first banished the Count of Mortain,
Earl of Cornwall, who claimed also the Earldom of Kent in succession
to Odo of Bayeux, the possession of which would have
rendered him the most powerful noble in England, and then
proceeded to Normandy to continue his attacks upon Belesme.
He alleged not only the reception of his exiles, but the general
misgovernment of Robert, as an excuse for his proceedings; and in
truth, under that Prince, Normandy had become a scene of anarchy.
As an instance of this it is mentioned, that on his arrival a church
was pointed out to him full of property sent there for safety from
the hands of the marauding barons. He captured the towns of
Caen and Bayeux, and found allies in the persistent enemies of the
Dukes of Normandy, Fulk Count of Anjou, and Hélie de la Fléche,
who had succeeded in regaining the County of Maine. With Count
Robert of Flanders also he renewed friendly relations. With such
support he proved too strong for the Norman Duke, and
before the Castle of Tenchebray a battle was fought, on
the anniversary of the battle of Hastings, which ended
in favour of the King. Duke Robert himself, the Count of Mortain,
and Eadgar Ætheling, who had been serving with the Duke, were
taken prisoners. Eadgar was liberated, and died in peace in England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
some years after; but Duke Robert and the Count of Mortain
were imprisoned for the rest of their lives. Normandy and England
were thus again united.</p>

</div>

<p>The possession of Normandy brought Henry into more immediate
contact with France. Louis VI. was upon the throne
of that kingdom, the first of those great kings to whom
the monarchy owed its ultimate triumph over feudalism.
It was natural that he should look with jealousy on the vast strength
of his great vassal, and should attempt to curtail that power which
the supineness of his predecessor had allowed to accumulate. A
constant border warfare was the consequence, rendered the more
possible by the doubtful position of such counties as Maine, Evreux,
the Vexin, Blois, and Alençon, the counts of which were for ever
changing their allegiance. Louis had no difficulty in
finding a pretender to the Norman Duchy whom he
might use as his instrument in opposing the English
King. William, the son of Robert, had fallen into Henry’s hands,
and had been by him intrusted to the care of Hélie de St.
Saen. In 1110, in connection apparently with a movement of disaffected
nobility (for Braiose, Malet, and Bainard are mentioned
as being exiled at that time), Hélie fled with the young Prince, and
sought to raise all the neighbouring princes in his cause. Their
efforts were not successful. Henry’s arch-enemy, Robert of Belesme,
fell into the King’s hands at Bonneville, where he had presented
himself with extraordinary effrontery, trusting that a message with
which he was charged from the King of France would give him the
security due to an ambassador. The same year Theobald of Blois,
acting for Henry, defeated the French King at Puysac. And when
Henry himself succeeded in capturing the town of Alençon, and in
attaching the Count of Anjou to his interests, by giving him his heir,
William the Ætheling, as a husband for his daughter, Louis found
it desirable to conclude a peace at Gisors, by which he resigned
his claim of suzerainty over Maine, Belesme, and Brittany,
and left entirely unmentioned the rights of
William, son of Robert. There followed a period of
some years, during which Henry was able to live in tolerable peace
in England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prince William

<p>His position was, indeed, unusually strong. His son was contracted
to the daughter of the Earl of Anjou; his natural daughter to
Conan, son of Alan Fergant of Brittany; and, in the following year,
his daughter Adelaide or Matilda was married to the German Emperor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Henry V. He took this opportunity of securing the succession to
his son William, to whom, in the years 1115-1116,
he succeeded in inducing the barons both of England
and Normandy to promise their allegiance. But this
cessation of hostilities was not of long duration.</p>

</div>

<p>The causes of war had not been removed. There was still
chronic disaffection among the Norman barons, who
disliked the firmness of Henry’s rule; constant jealousy
upon the part of the French King; and the Pretender William,
the Clito as he is called, was an ever-ready instrument for their
hands. Thus the border warfare was renewed, and we hear of
the disaffection, not only of the King’s great barons, but of his
allies, both Robert of Flanders and Fulk of Anjou adopting
William’s cause. Other distresses likewise came upon
Henry. He lost his wife Matilda, and his firm and
sagacious minister, Robert of Mellent. But, in 1118, prosperity
again returned to him. The Count of Flanders was killed in an
attack upon the Count of Eu. Money or negotiation won back
the friendship of Fulk, and in the following year a battle between
a few knights at Brenneville, at which both Henry
and Louis were present in person, was regarded as so
decisive a victory for the English, that, by the mediation
of Pope Calixtus, a new Treaty was arranged, and William’s
interest completely disregarded. Thus was triumphantly closed the
second of Henry’s wars in France.</p>

<p>At this period of his greatest prosperity a blow fell <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'upon Henry which'">upon Henry
from which</ins> he is said never to have recovered. He was
returning in triumph to England, when a certain
Thomas Fitz-Stephen, whose father had conveyed the
Conqueror to England, claimed the privilege of conveying the royal
party. To gratify him, Prince William, with the king’s natural
daughter Matilda, the Countess of Perche, and other young nobles,
consented to embark in his ship called the “Blanche Nef.” They
remained behind the rest of the fleet and celebrated the occasion in
festivity, which ended in the drunkenness of the crew. As they rode
upon the harbour of Barfleur in the moonlight they suddenly struck
upon the rocks of the Ras de Catte, and there was barely time for the
young Prince to escape in a boat from the sinking ship. The cries of
his sister are said to have induced William to return towards the
wreck, when the hurried rush of the despairing crew capsized his
boat, and all on board were drowned. Of the whole crew of the ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
one only, Berold, a butcher of Rouen, survived, owing his safety to
the warmth afforded him by his rough garb of undressed sheepskins.
With fear and trembling the news was broken to Henry by the young
son of Count Theobald of Blois. Henry is said to have fallen fainting
from his seat, and from that time onwards never to have relaxed into
a smile.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Insurrection of

<div class="sidenotex">Death of
William Clito.</div>
</div>

<p>The death of Prince William was not only a domestic misfortune.
By it was broken also the tie which bound the Count of
Anjou to Henry’s interests. It was a natural jealousy
of his great neighbour, the Norman Duke, which had
induced Fulk to act in alliance with Henry. When Robert’s imprisonment
put Henry on the throne of Normandy, he in turn
became the object of Fulk’s enmity. The state of the Duchy, where
a disaffected party constantly existed, afforded him ample opportunity
of giving effect to that enmity. Thus, in 1124, Henry was again
recalled to Normandy to suppress a rebellion in favour of William
Clito, who was supported by Anjou. Not only Anjou but France
was inclining to join the rebels, and it was only by instigating his
son-in-law the Emperor to attack France that Henry could manage
to make head against his opponents. As it was, however, a fortunate
surprise by which all the leaders fell into his hands enabled
him to crush the rebellion, and again induced the foreign powers to
desert William. The King of France indeed did not wholly give
him up; but in 1127, after investing him with several important
territories, he brought him forward as a claimant to the throne of
Flanders, to which he had a claim through his grandmother, Matilda,
the Conqueror’s wife, who was a daughter of Baldwin, Count of
Flanders. Against him Henry supported the claims of Diederik or
Dirk, Count of Alsace, the last count’s nephew, and
his rightful heir. The matter came to war, and in July
1128, before Alost, Prince William was wounded, and died of his
wounds. Henry was thus rid of his most formidable opponent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempt to
secure the
succession to
Matilda.</div>

<p>It remained for him to secure the succession for his daughter
Matilda, and he induced all the great men of England
to acknowledge her, and swear to support her claims.
The list of those who swore was headed by the Archbishop
of Canterbury, followed by the King’s nephew, Stephen
of Boulogne, and his natural son, Robert of Gloucester. They
always declared that they accepted the oath on the condition
that she should not be married to a foreigner without their consent,
and therefore many of them held themselves absolved from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
oath, when she was betrothed and ultimately married to Geoffrey,
son of the Count of Anjou.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of Henry.</div>

<p>The close of his reign was chiefly occupied in arranging disputes
in consequence of this marriage. It was while still
in Normandy on this business, though his presence was
imperatively demanded in England to suppress an insurrection
in Wales, that he died, as it is said, of the effects of a hearty meal
of lampreys on the 1st of December 1135.</p>

<div class="sn-box">

</div>

<p>Throughout the reign he had had considerable difficulties with the
Welsh, for although, as has been said, many Norman
knights and barons had established strongholds among
them, they were by no means subdued. They took
part in the insurrection of Robert of Belesme; and Henry, conscious
that they would be difficult to conquer, hit upon the plan
of establishing among them colonies of Flemings, many of whom
had come over with the Conqueror, and still more about the
year 1106, driven from their country by inundations. The land
granted them was in the western part of Wales, near Haverfordwest
and Tenby, where they acted at once as a military post, and, through
their knowledge of manufacture and agriculture, as an instrument of
civilization. In 1114 the Welsh rose under Gryffith. The occupation
of Caermarthen and Cardigan, where Gilbert Strongbow, Earl of
Strigul, was at that time commanding, separated the Flemings from
the English, and Henry was compelled to march to their rescue.
This insurrection was suppressed by Robert of Gloucester, himself
the son of Gryffith’s sister.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Small insurrections continued.
In 1122 Henry again went in person to Wales,
but, on the whole, the inhabitants were kept in subjection by the
Flemings and by numerous Norman castles till 1134, when they were
provoked to a new outbreak, so important that the King was preparing
to cross from Normandy to suppress it, when he died.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Synod of
Westminster.</div>
</div>

<p>At home the great points of Henry’s reign were those which form
the domestic history of all feudal monarchies, the
relation of the Church and State, and the maintenance
of police. With regard to the Church his views were those
of his father. He was ready to support and increase its influence;
he was not ready to give up any of the prerogatives which his predecessors
had possessed. He thus reversed all the action of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
brother, recalled Anselm at once with marked honour, and filled up
the vacant benefices. But the Archbishop during his exile had
mixed in Continental politics, at that time consisting almost entirely
of the question of investitures. He returned home determined to
assert to the full the independence of the Church. He therefore
refused to swear fealty, and do homage to the King,
or to consecrate those bishops who had received their
investitures from him. Henry, supported by his lay counsellors,
was equally determined to uphold the rights of the crown. The
matter was referred to the Pope, Pascal II. The Papacy had
enemies enough already, and could not afford to drive to extremities
a Prince so powerful, and in the main so friendly, as Henry. The
reply which was returned was ambiguous. Henry again commanded
the Archbishop to perform his usual duties. A second application to
Rome produced no better result. Anselm was urged to perseverance.
Henry’s ambassadors were given to understand that, as long as his
appointments were good, the King should not be interfered with. Firm
in his own views, but uncertain as to the Pope’s wishes, Anselm had
no course open to him but to visit Rome in person. He
there met with but lukewarm support, and withdrew to
Lyons, while Henry laid hands upon all the revenues of the archbishopric.
For some time Anselm rejected all offers of compromise;
but when, after all his efforts, he could induce the Pope to go no
further than the excommunication, not of the King, but of some of
his ministers, he lost heart, and, in 1106, a compromise was arranged
at Bec, by which Henry retained the really important part of investiture,
the oaths of fealty and homage, while resigning the
idle symbol of the gift of ring and crozier. This compromise,
which was the same in effect as that made
sixteen years afterwards at Worms between Henry V.
and Calixtus II., set at rest for the present that rivalry between
Church and State which the policy of the Conqueror had introduced.
The decrees of a Synod held at Westminster, 1102, by
Anselm before going to Rome, show the abuses which
the ecclesiastical disputes of the last reign had introduced. They are
directed against such habits as simony, marriage of the clergy, the
assumption of lay dress by ecclesiastics, the holding of secular courts
by bishops, the adoration of unauthorized saints and relics, and
vindicate the claims of the Church to be considered as the chief
civilizing agent of the time by forbidding the selling of men for
slaves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Frequent unfit

<p>It was not always that the Church appeared in such an amiable
light. Henry no doubt, on the whole, attempted to
make good appointments, but interest or desire to
reward an ardent partisan sometimes put an unfit person
into office. Thus Henry of Poitou was given the
Abbey of Peterborough, although he already held an
abbey in France, apparently as a reward for the support he gave the
King in upholding the illegality of the marriage between William
Clito and Sibylla of Anjou on the score of consanguinity. “He
came like a drone to a hive,” says the chronicler; “all that the bees
draw towards them the drones devour and draw from them, so did
he.” It is fair to say that Henry, when he found out how bad a
person he had appointed, had him removed. “It was not very long
after that that the King sent for him, and made him give up the
Abbey of Peterborough, and go out of the land.” Thus, again, after
a great distribution of abbeys in 1107, it is remarked “that the
abbots were rather wolves than shepherds.” Such complaints are
however usually uttered by English writers, and the plight of the
conquered people was evidently very miserable.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Wretched
condition of
the people.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Extracts from
old chroniclers.</div>
</div>

<p>It was a time of great suffering on more accounts than one, and
the suffering was of a kind to fall chiefly upon the
lower orders. Agriculture was so rough that any little
irregularity in the seasons produced a failure of the
crops, and the habits of the people were such that any infectious
disease was liable to become a pestilence. The constant warfare,
either against his vassals or his enemies, which the King carried on,
was the cause of frequent taxation, against which no class in the
State had it in their power to remonstrate; while the natural and
artificial causes of suffering were further aggravated by the frequent
issue of false coin. Thus we find year after year such entries as
these in the chroniclers:&mdash;“The year 1105 was very
miserable, because of the failure of the crops, and the
ceaseless taxation.” “The year 1110 was full of wretchedness,
because of the bad season, and the tribute the King demanded for his
daughter’s dowry.” “In this year (1124) were many failures in
England in corn and all fruit, so that between Christmas and
Candlemas the acre seed of wheat was sold for six shillings; and
that of barley, that is three seedlips for three shillings, the acre seed
of oats for four shillings, because there was little corn, and the penny
was so bad that a man who had at market a pound could by no
means buy therewith twelvepenny-worth.” “In this same year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
(1125) was so great a flood on St. Lawrence’s mass day that many
towns and men were drowned, and bridges shattered; corn and
meadows totally destroyed, and for all fruits there was so bad a
season as there had not been for many years before.” “In that
year (1131) there was so great a murrain of cattle as never was in
the memory of man.” This carried off neat, swine, and domestic fowls
alike. And when the harvest was good the pestilence came. “This
year (1112) was a very good year, and very abundant in wood and
field, but it was a very sorrowful one through a most destructive
pestilence.” Or again, the year 1104, “It is not easy to recount
all the miseries the country suffered this year through various and
manifold illegalities and imposts which never ceased nor failed,
and ever as the King went there was plundering by his followers
on his wretched people, and at the same time often burnings and
murders.”</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Their chief

<div class="sidenotex">Baronial tyranny.</div>
</div>

<p>In these extracts, which might be largely multiplied, the chief
causes of the people’s misery are mentioned. Heavy
taxes, famines, floods, pestilence, false money, and purveyance.
To attempt to rectify such of these as were within the
power of man, was one main part of Henry’s duty. To that was
added the work of suppressing, by a centralized royal power, the
excesses of the feudal barons. What crying necessity there was
that they should be suppressed is made plain by the stories related
of Robert of Belesme, their chief. He is spoken of as guilty of the
most unheard-of barbarities, as having scorned the
ransoms of his captives to torture them by newfangled
instruments; he found delight in seeing men and women impaled
and struggling in the agonies of death. “He was a man,” says
William of Malmesbury, “intolerable for the barbarity of his
manners, remarkable besides for cruelty;” and, among other instances,
he relates how, on account of some trifling fault of its
father, he blinded his godchild, who was his hostage, by tearing out
the poor little creature’s eyes with “his accursed nails.”</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Heavy taxation.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Henry cures
what evils he
can.</div>
</div>

<p>One complaint of his people Henry systematically disregarded.
He could not afford to do without his taxes, and on all
classes on this point he leant with a heavy hand. But
in other respects, as far as in him lay, he rectified abuses of administration,
and established a vigorous and effectual police. The evils
of purveyance had become extreme; no property was safe from the
hands of the followers of the court, and when they found larger
supplies than they wanted, “if it was liquor they washed their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
horses’ feet in it, or food they wantonly destroyed it.” But Henry
made a regulation for the followers of his court, at
whichever of his residences he might be, stating what
they should take without payment from the country
folk, and how much, and at what price they should purchase, punishing
the transgressors by heavy fine or loss of life. So with regard to
false coinage, immediately after the complaint of high prices in the
year 1124, it is mentioned that Henry at once sent from Normandy
to England, and commanded that all the moneyers should have their
right hands cut off, and be otherwise mutilated. Bishop Roger
of Salisbury sent all over England, commanded them all to come
before him, and then and there punished upwards of fifty. Henry was
careful, indeed, in other ways with regard to the money, having the
whole of the coinage broken to prevent the refusal of broken silver
pennies; for it seems to have been the custom to break the coinage
to see that the money was good, and tradesmen not unfrequently
refused the broken coins.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His strict
police.</div>

<p>Against offences of violence Henry was equally vigorous. At
one single court held in Leicestershire by Basset the
Justiciary, during the King’s absence in 1124, no less
than forty-four thieves were condemned and hanged, besides others
mutilated. “He sought after robbers and counterfeiters with the
greatest diligence, and punished them when discovered,” says William
of Malmesbury. Rivalling his father also in other respects, he
restrained by edict the acts of his courtiers, thefts, rapine, and the
violation of women, commanding the delinquents to be deprived of
sight. He also displayed singular vigilance against the mint masters,
suffering no man who had been guilty of “deluding the innocent by
the practice of roguery” to escape without losing his hands. “A
good man he was,” says the Saxon Chronicle, “and all men stood in
awe of him; no man durst misdo against another in his time. He
made peace for man and beast. Whoso bare his burden of gold and
silver, no man thirst do him aught but good.”</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Local courts.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Curia Regis.</div>
</div>

<p>To carry out this strict police some apparatus was necessary, which
at the same time should serve the purpose of diminishing
the power of the great nobles, and that of beginning
at all events, by its centralizing influence, to re-form the conquered
people and their conquerors into one nation. The rudiments of such
an apparatus Henry found already existing in the arrangements which
the Conqueror had made. The system of frankpledge, increased and
adapted to the more general feudal form of society, supplied him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
with an efficient system of police. There was no man in the kingdom
but some one was answerable for him. If he was a vassal, his
lord. If he was a freeman, the knot of freemen of which he was a
member. As courts to carry out this system, there
were the old Hundred and Shire gemots. These Henry
strengthened and, it would seem from one existing order, restored
when in any way decayed to their original purity. To these courts
criminal cases belonged, and civil suits between vassals of different
lords. Questions between vassals of the same lord seem to have
fallen within the jurisdiction of the lord. But these inferior courts,
although they were excellent for police purposes, and as a check
upon the powers of the baronial courts, would have done little
towards the formation of nationality had they not been brought into
connection with a superior court of which the king was chief. This
central court consisted of the King in his ordinary council, which,
since the Conquest, was known as the Curia Regis.
Over it was the justiciary, who was the King’s representative,
his regent during his absence, the head of his administration,
both judicial and financial, at all times. Under him was a
selection of barons, the chief officers of the royal household, and
those best qualified for judicial purposes. The clerks of this court
were placed under a head, who was the chancellor. The judges
themselves sat for financial purposes in the exchequer chamber, and
were spoken of as the barons of the exchequer. For general business
they were called justices, and their head the chief-justice. The
organization of this court dates from the reign of Henry I. The office
of chief justiciary had been founded by William the Conqueror, but the
regular formation of the Exchequer Court was the work of Roger,
Bishop of Salisbury, in the hands of whose family the direction of the
machinery remained for nearly a century.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> It was afterwards, as we
shall see, brought to its completion by Henry II., but all its essential
parts are to be found in the reign of his grandfather. It was as
officers of finance that the justices first began to traverse the country.
The sheriffs could not always be trusted in their own localities, and
change of property and other causes gave rise to difficult questions,
requiring to be settled by the immediate intervention of the King’s
officers. From financial questions their authority naturally passed to
questions of justice, and their connection with the local courts was
further strengthened when Henry united several sheriffdoms under
one of his justices. Following a natural tendency, the men employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
for these offices were not the great barons, but new men, who rose by
their talents, and were naturally upholders of the royal power and
of order in opposition to the anarchical baronial party.</p>

<p>To sum up; after the year 1108, when the local courts were re-established,
both the Hundred and county courts were the same in
constitution and in arrangement as before the Conquest. But they were
connected with the central government; because matters in which the
King was interested were set aside for the consideration of the Curia
Regis, or travelling justiciary sent out from that body; and because
the Norman lawyers had introduced the practice of issuing writs from
the King’s court, whereby the King, in virtue of what is called his
“equitable power,” that is, his power of securing justice where the
law did not give it, prescribed the method of action in certain difficult
cases. The Hundred court was sometimes a lower court for the
arrangement of small debts; the Bailiff of the Hundred then presided.
Sometimes it was the great court held only twice a year; the sheriff
then presided, the court exercised criminal jurisdiction, and was
known as the “Court Leet.” It also saw to the filling up of the
divisions of ten men required by the system of Frankpledge; this was
called “the view of frankpledge.” The court was then known as “the
Sheriff’s Tourn.” Below these local courts were the feudal manor
courts, the old motes of the township, now become the courts of the
lord. But we must not suppose that the authority of the sheriff and
the local courts (now virtually royal courts) was universal. Certain
great lords enjoyed franchises, that is, exercised jurisdiction over several
manors. If the lord had “sac and soc,” his court had the authority
of the Court Leet. If he had “the view of frankpledge,” the suitors
at his court were free from attendance at the Sheriff’s Tourn. His
court was then in all points like the Hundred court, but independent
of the sheriff. This double system Henry had apparently to submit
to, watching the baronial power as well as he could, by means of
the local courts and travelling justices.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The National
Assembly.</div>

<p>It is to be carefully remembered that though the Curia Regis,
representing the King’s council, attested charters, and revised and
registered laws, it had no legislative authority. Both the imposition
of taxes and the making of laws still rested with the King and his
great council, the representative of the Witan, which
had become a feudal court, and consisted chiefly of the
King’s vassals. Their “counsel and consent” was a necessary condition
of all legislation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stephen’s
accession.</div>

<p class="drop-cap">On Henry’s death, according to the oath of the nobles, Matilda,
late Empress, now wife of Geoffrey of Anjou,
should have become Duchess of Normandy and Queen of
England. But the principle of hereditary succession was by no
means firmly established; a female sovereign was not desirable for a
feudal country; her child Henry was an infant; and the nobles
held that the conditions of their oath of fealty had been broken when
Matilda had married a foreigner. There was therefore almost a
unanimous feeling that one or other of the Princes of Blois, grandsons
of the Conqueror, Theobald the elder brother, or Stephen, Count
of Mortain and Boulogne, should ascend the throne. Steps were
being taken in Normandy to induce Theobald to come forward,
when news was brought to him that the superior quickness of his
brother Stephen had already secured the crown in England, where,
though not without some demur, the influence of the Church, headed
by his brother Henry of Winchester, had secured him success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Strange
character of the
reign.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Great power of
the Church.</div>
</div>

<p>There followed a period of twenty years without a parallel in the
history of England. It was the only time during which
the feudal baronage assumed that position of practical
independence which it was always aiming at, which it
frequently enjoyed abroad, but which the wise management and
strong government of the Conqueror and his two sons had rendered
impossible in England. The weak title of the King, and the constantly
urged claim of the Empress, joined with the personal character
of Stephen, who seems to have been unable to refuse a request,
afforded an opportunity to the barons of asserting virtual independence
and fighting for their own interests, while nominally upholding
one or other of the claimants to the throne. The same causes
affected the Church, which was now able to make good
that commanding position which the legislation of the
Conqueror had given it, although up to this time the strong hand of
the King had rendered the position worthless. The only organized
power in the midst of anarchy, it was enabled to use its influence
to the full. It was the Church that set Stephen on the throne; it
was his quarrel with the bishops which lit up the civil war in England;
the success of the Empress was of no avail till she was
accepted by the Church; her attack upon Henry of Winchester was
the signal for her discomfiture; it was the mediation of the Church
which ultimately produced a cessation of the war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The interest of
the reign.</div>

<p>The facts of the reign are few and in themselves unimportant.
To the growth of the constitution it added nothing.
It is nevertheless interesting as exhibiting the effects of
unbridled feudalism, and as preparing the way for the great work of
consolidation perfected by Henry II.; on the one hand by the
misery and disgust excited by the lawless outrages of the barons;
on the other by the overwhelming power thrown into the hands of
the Church, which could not co-exist with any true national
monarchy.</p>

<div class="sn-box">

<div class="sidenotex">Affairs in Wales.</div>
</div>

<p>On his coronation, Stephen, in general terms, promised to uphold
the good laws of his predecessors. At the first great
council of his reign he issued a more explicit charter,
securing to the Church their property and privileges, and promising
to suppress illegalities on the part of the sheriffs. The character of
the reign rendered such a charter quite inoperative. The insurrection
in Wales, which had been bringing Henry to England
when he died, continued. Its conduct fell chiefly to
Ranulf, Earl of Chester, and Richard Fitz-Gilbert of Clare. Stephen’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
presence on the borders did not succeed in checking it. Richard
Fitz-Gilbert was killed, and he left the country as before to be conquered
by the gradual advance of the lords marchers.</p>

</div>

<p>Already, it would seem, the yielding character of Stephen had been
discovered. Already barons began to take advantage of
it. Roger Bigot seized the Castle of Norwich, and
wrested from the King the earldom of that county and of East
Anglia. Robert of Bathenton and Baldwin of Redvers, in Devonshire,
began to rebel. They were indeed both conquered, but such
movements mark the temper of the times. In 1137 Stephen found
himself strong enough to cross to Normandy, where Geoffrey of Anjou
was making war upon his provinces. His success there was not
great. He purchased from Geoffrey a cessation of hostilities. Meanwhile
the Northern frontier of England had become a scene of war.
David of Scotland, the nephew of Eadgar Ætheling, and
uncle through his sister Matilda of the Empress, had
himself some claims to the English throne. But these
he declared that he waived, wishing to abide true to the oath he had
taken to support his niece. He, however, demanded that his son
Henry should be allowed to do homage to Stephen for Cumberland,
and that he himself should receive the counties of Northumberland
and Huntingdon, which he claimed in right of his wife, the daughter
of Earl Waltheof. Though he himself declared that he had no desire
for the English throne, there is mentioned by one chronicler<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> a general
conspiracy of the native English with their exiled
countrymen, of whom the south of Scotland was full,
for the purpose of taking advantage of the condition of
the country to put to death the Normans, and to place the crown
upon David’s head. The plot was discovered by the Bishop of Ely,
who was at once Bishop and Governor of that district, which had
been formed by the last king into a modified county palatine. He
told his discovery, and many of the conspirators were hanged, but
many others found a refuge in Scotland. At length, in 1138,
David entered England with a large army, and pushed forward
as far as Northallerton in Yorkshire. He was there met by
the forces of the Northern bishops and barons, gathered under
the command of Walter Espec, Thurstan, the aged Archbishop of
York, William of Albemarle, Roger of Mowbray, and other barons.
They gathered round a tall mast borne upon a carriage, on which,
above the standards of the three Northern Saints, St. Peter of York,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
St. John of Beverley, and St. Wilfred of Ripon, was displayed a
silver pyx bearing the consecrated wafer. The motley
army of the Scots, some armed as the English, some in
the wild dress of the Picts of Galloway, after a well-fought
battle, broke against the full-clad Norman soldiers, and were
killed by the arrows, which had now become the national weapon of
the English; 11,000 are said to have fallen on the field. But, in
spite of the victory, Stephen, conscious of his general weakness,
accepted an unfavourable peace, by which Northumberland was given
to Prince Henry.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Growth of
anarchy in
England.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Creation of
earldoms and
castles.</div>
</div>

<p>All this time the spirit of lawlessness had been increasing. “Many
persons,” says the chronicler,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> “emboldened to illegal
acts, either by nobility of descent or by ambition, were
not ashamed, some to demand castles, others estates, and
indeed whatever came into their fancy, from the King. When he
delayed complying with their request ... they, becoming enraged,
immediately fortified their castles against him, and drove away large
booties from his lands.” “He created likewise many earls where
there had been none before; appropriating to them rents which had
before belonged to the crown. They were the more greedy in
asking, and he more profuse in giving, because a rumour was pervading
England that Robert of Gloucester would shortly espouse the
cause of his sister.” The creation of earldoms had been rare under
the three first Norman kings, and as those offices died out their
places had not been filled. It is said, indeed, that in 1131 there
were but three earls in England, Robert of Gloucester, and the Earls
of Chester and Leicester.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> As the earl received the third penny of
the fines of his earldom, the creation of earls manifestly
impoverished the crown. But Stephen appears to have
gone beyond the filling up of regular earldoms, and to
have created titular earls,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> with grants of royal demesne lands to
support their dignity. The building of castles<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> was the great sign of
the anarchical condition of England, implying private war and all
the other horrors of the worst forms of continental feudalism.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Stephen’s

</div>

<p>This anarchy began to assume a form when Robert of Gloucester,
alleging his previous oath to Matilda, and asserting that the conditions
on which he had accepted Stephen had not been kept, renounced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
his fealty. His influence was in his earldom, and in the West of
England; the headquarters of his party was Bristol;
and his agent during his absence was Milo, Constable
of Gloucester, afterwards Earl of Hereford. Nearly all
the West, and by no means the West only, declared for
Matilda. But in most cases the rival claims to the throne were used
as an excuse merely. Change of sides was common, and there are
instances of leaders excluding their own nominal partisans from
strongholds they had won.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> At first the insurrection was unsuccessful.
Stephen, conscious of his weakness, had collected
mercenaries from Flanders and from Brittany. The
condition of the country made them eager to come. In Stephen’s
time numbers of freebooters from Flanders and Brittany flocked to
England in expectation of pillage.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The chief leader of the Flemings
was William of Ypres; the Bretons were commanded by Alan the
Black of Richmond, Hervé of Léon, and Alan of Dinan. With the
aid of these Stephen speedily regained the great castles he had lost,
such as Bath, Castlecary, Harptree, and Shrewsbury; and might perhaps
even yet have established his authority, when an act of supreme
folly set him at variance with the Church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jealousy
between the
old and new
administration.</div>

<p>The new administrative class was represented by Roger of Salisbury,
who had succeeded in procuring for his nephew Alexander
the bishopric of Lincoln, for Nigel the bishopric of Ely, while
his illegitimate son Roger was Chancellor. The vast wealth and
influence of this family encouraged them to build castles, and Devizes,
Sherborne, Malmesbury, and Salisbury were strongly fortified. The
family of Beaumont, Earls of Mellent, had been generally firm
supporters of the crown and of authority. They now
seem to have seen with jealousy their position as
the chief advisers to the crown occupied by men of law,
ecclesiastics, yet without the sanctity which befits the
ecclesiastical profession. At their instigation, and at that of their
friends, the King took the ill-advised step of beginning his assault on
his castle-building barons by demanding the surrender of these
bishops’ castles. The Bishops of Lincoln and Salisbury were suddenly
arrested at an assembly held at Oxford (1139); the Bishop
of Ely took refuge in the castle of Devizes. Thither the King betook
himself, with his two prisoners, as some accounts assert, kept entirely
without food, one in a cow-stall and the other in a hovel. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
treatment of the bishops, and a threat of hanging Roger the Chancellor,
produced the surrender of Devizes as well as the other three
castles.</p>

</div>

<p>The success was dearly bought. The King’s brother, Henry of
Winchester, upheld the dignity of his order. He summoned
a council, produced a Papal letter declaring
him legate, proceeded to lay his charges against the
King before the council, and advised him to submit to canonical
punishment. Stephen’s case was defended by Aubrey de Vere, who,
when the aggrieved bishops spoke of an appeal to Rome, declared
that the King advised them not to do so, as whoever went might find
it difficult to return; and himself appealed to the jurisdiction of
the Pope. This threat, and an ominous appearance of
drawn swords around the meeting, prevented the bishops
from proceeding to extremities; but none the less had
Stephen forfeited their support. The immediate effect was the
arrival of Gloucester and the Empress in the South of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Civil war.</div>

<p>After a short stay at Arundel, the Empress withdrew to join her
brother, who had preceded her, at Bristol. There had been a
friendly meeting with Henry of Winchester upon their arrival, and
it was the same Henry who escorted the Empress to join her brother.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
The scene of confusion became still more confused.
Brian Fitz-Count<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> held Wallingford for the Empress;
Milo of Gloucester regained many of the Western castles which
Stephen had won. In Cornwall, Reginald of Dunstanville, a brother
of the Earl of Gloucester, upheld, though without much success, the
cause of the Empress. In Wiltshire, Fitz-Hubert, a Fleming, and
Fitz-Gilbert fought nominally for the Empress, really for themselves,
till Fitz-Gilbert enticed Fitz-Hubert, who had refused admission to
the partisans of the Empress for whom he was nominally fighting,
to the Castle of Marlborough, and there hanged him.</p>

<p>The quarrel between Stephen and his bishops grew worse and worse.
Roger of Salisbury died in 1139. The Bishop of Winchester
demanded the See for his nephew. Again Waleram
of Mellent thwarted the Church, and his request
was refused. At the Whitsuntide festival (1141) held in London,
but one bishop,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and that a foreign one, was with the court. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
state of uncertain anarchy was becoming highly distasteful to Robert
of Gloucester. An opportunity occurred of bringing matters to a
crisis. Ranulph, the Earl of Chester, had hitherto played fast and
loose with both parties, and the King had parted from him at Lincoln,
which he possessed in right of his mother Lucia, believing him
to be his partisan. But, a few days after his departure, Ranulph and
his brother William of Roumare, surprised the castle, on which the
King, who was a good soldier and very rapid in his movements,
suddenly came back and besieged it. Ranulph escaped
from the castle to Robert of Gloucester, who seized the
occasion to bring on a pitched battle. With Ranulph,
his own partisans, and the Welsh, he reached the Trent,
passed it with some difficulty, and appeared suddenly
before Lincoln. A great battle ensued, in which the victory fell to
Gloucester, and Stephen was himself taken prisoner.</p>

</div>

<p>Of course this defeat somewhat changed the balance of affairs.
Cornwall was regained for the Empress, and her influence reached
eastward as far as Bedford and Nottingham. But she
could not hope in any true sense to obtain the crown
without the consent of the all-powerful Church. At
once therefore negotiations were opened with Henry of Winchester.
Having won his adherence, and with it that of the greater part of the
bishops, she went from Gloucester, accompanied by the Bishop of Ely
and other supporters, to Winchester. In an open plain without the
city she swore to follow the advice of the Legate on Church matters.
Her oath was attested by Milo, afterwards Earl of Hereford, Earl
Gloucester, Brian Fitz-Count, and others. A council of the Church
was held a few days after. The Legate addressed
the assembly, and declared his adhesion to Matilda.
It is to be observed that he waited a day to receive
the citizens of London, who were “as it were nobles by reason of
the magnitude of the city.” Both the Londoners and many of the
nobility besought for the release of Stephen, but their request was
refused, and many of the royal party executed. Having obtained
the castle of Oxford from Robert of Oilli, Matilda proceeded to London;
but there the haughtiness of her behaviour soon produced the
ruin of her cause.</p>

</div>

<p>It seems as though, if he could only have regained his liberty, Stephen
himself and his partisans would have been willing now to retire from
the contest. The Earls of Leicester and Mellent, hitherto staunch supporters
of the King, together with his old friend Hugh, the Bishop of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Rouen, went so far as to offer the crown to Stephen’s brother
Theobald. But that prince declined to receive it, and even advised
them to transfer their offer to Geoffrey of Anjou, on the
sole condition that Stephen should be liberated. Taking
advantage of such an opportunity as this, while supported
by the friendship of Henry of Winchester and the
Londoners, Matilda might have made her throne secure, but she at
once took steps which alienated both. To Henry of Winchester, who
must naturally have felt the ties of relationship towards his brother,
she refused the natural request that Stephen’s son Eustace might be
placed in possession of his father’s foreign fiefs. From the Londoners
she demanded a heavy tallage, in spite of their complaints that they
had been already stripped by taxations. King Stephen’s Queen, to
whom many of the fugitives from Lincoln had betaken themselves,
made use of the discontent thus excited to advance against London.
The inhabitants rose, and the Empress barely escaped with a few
followers to Oxford. The insurgents demanded the liberation of
Stephen. In this demand the Bishop of Winchester now
joined, and the Empress besieged him in his castle outside
the town of Winchester. But her besieging army was
soon itself besieged, its communications and means of subsistence cut
off, and she found herself obliged to retire. The Earl of Gloucester
therefore despatched her before him to Devizes, while he
himself covered her retreat. But he was hotly pursued
and taken prisoner. This neutralized all his previous
successes. After some negotiations the great prisoners
were exchanged, and the state of parties fell back very much to its
position before the battle of Lincoln.</p>

<p>Of decided successes on either side there were none. In 1142, the
Empress, hard pressed at Oxford, barely made her escape with two
knights, all clothed in white, across the snow. In the following
year Stephen, on the other hand, suffered a defeat at
Wilton. The same struggle for individual liberty on
the part of the barons was apparent everywhere. Thus
the Cathedral of Coventry was changed into a fortress by a baron of
the name of Marmion, the Abbey of Ramsey by Mandeville. Nor
did the retirement of several of the hotter spirits from the contest to
join in a crusade which St. Bernard was then preaching materially
change the aspect of affairs. But, in 1147, new actors
begin to appear upon the scene. Wearied with the long
useless struggle, Matilda withdrew to France. But to take her place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
her son Prince Henry came over to England. As it were to
match him, Stephen brought his son Eustace prominently forward.
This change of persons is still more clearly marked by
the death of the great Earl of Gloucester, a man to whom
many acts of cruelty in accordance with the temper of
the time could be attributed, but who, if we may judge from the
testimony of William of Malmesbury, was far superior in character
and civilization to most of those by whom he was surrounded.</p>

</div>

<p>The withdrawal of the Empress and the appearance of Henry
made a considerable difference in the views of those barons in England
who were not wholly selfish. Stephen had been tried and
failed. They had no longer to fear the rule of a woman. And thus
we find Robert of Leicester, second son of the great Earl of Mellent,
who had hitherto served Stephen and done him good service in Normandy
against the Angevins, giving in his adherence to the young
prince. In company with his cousin Roger of Warwick, he held the
town and castle of Worcester for him, and succeeded in driving off
the royal army. Henry’s accession to the county of Anjou upon the
death of his father Geoffrey, in 1151, and still more his
marriage with Eleanor, the divorced wife of Louis,
heiress of Poitiers and Guienne, changed the character of
the war. He was no longer a poor claimant, at best the son of a count,
but had been suddenly transformed into one of the most powerful
princes in Europe. In addition to this, since the death of Pope
Innocent in 1144, the Papal See had been taking a more
decided course against Stephen. The legatine authority
had been withdrawn from Henry of Winchester, whose relationship
with Stephen made his action always doubtful, and been given to
Theobald the Archbishop, but Stephen, with his usual want of
address, contrived to quarrel with him, and he therefore threw his
whole weight upon the side of Henry.</p>

</div>

<p>Thus, when Henry contrived to form a truce with his rival the
French King, and to enter England with a considerable army, the
country was much disposed to receive him. Many of the nobility
began to declare for him. The Beaumonts, as we have seen, were
already his friends. The Countess of Warwick placed her castle in
his hands. Robert of Leicester supplied him with provisions, and he
marched in good hope to relieve Wallingford, which, defended
by Brian Fitz-Count, Stephen was now besieging.
There the two armies met; but the desire for peace was
so general, that they both demanded that negotiations should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
opened. Nothing was then settled, but the armies separated.
Stephen proceeded to besiege Ipswich, where Bigot had declared for
Henry, and Henry, taking Nottingham on the way, was marching to
relieve it, when the heads of the Church saw their opportunity,
and Theobald and Henry of Winchester combined
to mediate a peace. This was the more easy on account
of the death of the young Prince Eustace. On the 7th of November
the Treaty of Pacification was concluded at Winchester. It was a
compromise. Stephen was to remain King of England during his
life; Henry was to be accepted as his son and heir; Stephen’s son
William was to do homage to Henry for all his large possessions in
England and in Normandy. There then followed an arrangement
for restoring the administration which the war had ruined. The
castles were to be razed, the coinage reformed, the sheriffs replaced,
the crown lands resumed, the new earldoms extinguished, foreigners
banished, and administration of justice restored.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> After this treaty
Henry’s duties summoned him chiefly to France; and
Stephen, for the short remnant of his life, remained
undisputed King of England. He died on the 25th of
October 1154.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Quotations from
chroniclers.
The miseries of
this reign.</div>

<p>Two short extracts from chroniclers give a more complete view of
the misery which attended this lawless period than any
fresh description could do. William of Newbury says:
“Wounded and drained of blood by civil misery, England
lay plague-stricken. It is written of an ancient people, ‘In those
days there was no king in Israel, and every man did that which was
right in his own eyes;’ but in England, under King Stephen, the
case was worse. For, because at that time the King was powerless,
and the law languished because the King was powerless, though
some indeed did what seemed right in their own eyes, many because
all fear of King and law was taken off them, did all the more greedily
what by their natural instincts they knew to be wrong....
Neither King nor Empress was able to act in a masterful way, or
show vigorous discipline. But each kept their own followers in good
temper by refusing them nothing lest they should desert them....
And because they were worn out by daily strife, and acted less
vigorously, local disturbances of hostile lords grew the more vehement.
Castles too rose in great numbers in the several districts, and there
were in England, so to speak, as many kings, or rather tyrants, as
lords of castles. Individuals took the right of coining their private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
money, and of private jurisdiction.” We have here the effects of the
loosened hold of the crown,&mdash;castles, private war, private coinage,
private justice. The Saxon Chronicle supplies us with a picture of
the effect of these feudal usurpations upon the lower ranks of the
people:&mdash;</p>

<p>“When the traitors perceived that Stephen was a mild man, and
soft and good, and did no justice, then did they all wonder. They
had done homage to him and sworn oaths, but held no faith; for
every powerful man made his castles and held them against him, and
they filled the land full of castles. They cruelly oppressed the
wretched men of the land with castle works. When the castles
were made, they filled them with devils and evil men. Then they
took those men that they imagined had any property, both by night
and by day, peasant men and women, and put them in prison for
their gold and silver, and tortured them with unutterable torture;
for never were martyrs so tortured as they were. They hanged them
up by the feet and smoked them with foul smoke; they hanged them
up by the thumbs or by the head, and hung fires on their feet; they
put knotted strings about their heads, and writhed them so that it
went to the brain. They put them in dungeons, in which were
adders, and snakes, and toads, and killed them so. Some they put
in a ‘cruset hûs,’ that is in a chest that was short and narrow and
shallow, and put sharp stones therein, and pressed the man therein,
so that they brake all his limbs. In many of the castles were
instruments called a ‘lāŏ (loathly) and grim;’ these were neck-bonds,
of which two or three men had enough to bear one. It was so made,
that is, it was fastened to a beam, and they put a sharp iron about the
man’s throat and his neck, so that he could not in any direction sit,
or lie, or sleep, but must bear all that iron. Many thousands they
killed with hunger; I neither can nor may tell all the wounds or all
the tortures which they inflicted on wretched men in this land; and
that lasted the nineteen winters while Stephen was King; and ever
it was worse and worse. They laid imposts on the towns continually;
and when the wretched men had no more to give, they robbed and
burned all the towns, so that thou mightest well go all a day’s
journey, and thou shouldest never find a man sitting in a town, or
the land tilled. Then was corn dear, and flesh and cheese and
butter; for there was none in the land. Wretched men died of
hunger; some went seeking alms who at one while were rich men;
some fled out of the land. Never yet had more wretchedness been in
the land, nor did heathen men ever do worse than they did; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
everywhere at times they forbore neither church nor churchyard, but
took all the property that was therein, and then burned the church
and altogether. Nor forbore they a bishop’s land, nor an abbot’s, nor
a priest’s, but robbed monks and clerks, and every man another who
anywhere could. If two or three men came riding to a town, all the
township fled before them, imagining them to be robbers. The
bishops and clergy constantly cursed them, but nothing came of it,
for they were all accursed, and forsworn, and lost. However a man
tilled, the earth bare no corn; for the land was all foredone by such
deeds, and they said openly that Christ and His saints slept. Such,
and more than we can say, we endured nineteen winters for our
sins.”</p>

<p>A people who had suffered these things must certainly have sighed
for a strong government, by whatever hand it should be wielded; and
miserable though the reign had been, it tended towards the consolidation
of nationality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Main objects
of Henry’s reign.<br /><br />
First acts of
his reign.</div>

<p class="drop-cap">The consolidation of the nation was the great work of Henry of
Anjou. He brought to it great gifts, sagacity, masterful
courage, a legal and judicial mind; while his training, as the prince of
widely extending countries, prevented the intrusion of
petty local interests into his views for his people’s good.
The lessons of the last reign were not lost on him. Before all things
he desired a strong government and good order. In pursuing these
objects he took for his model his grandfather and great-grandfather,
and worked out in greater and more systematic detail the policy they
had begun. And though in his efforts to subordinate the Church
he may seem to have run counter to the legislation of his great-grandfather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
it will be seen that in many points his policy was really
the same. In the earlier part of his reign work lay ready
to his hand, and the compromise at Winchester had
already marked out his line of action. He could not immediately
come to England, being detained by an insurrection in Guienne.
But when he had settled this, and, by a humility of bearing he knew
well how to feign, secured the friendship of Louis VII., he crossed the
Channel, and at once proceeded with his reforms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He restores
order in the
State.</div>

<p>He renewed the charter of the City of London; fixed a short period
during which the Flemish auxiliaries, who had already
probably begun to return home, should leave the country;
recalled grants of the royal domains which had been
made in Stephen’s reign; re-established the old number of limited
earldoms; and proceeded to lay hands on both the royal castles which
individual barons had appropriated and those private fastnesses with
which the country had become covered. Their number is variously
estimated, by some it is put as high as 1150. It was not without
some opposition that he carried out this work. It was chiefly in the
North and West that difficulty occurred. Before the year was
over he had received the submission of William of Albemarle, who
was nearly independent in Yorkshire. In February of the next year
he expelled Peveril, who had been guilty among other things of poisoning
the great Earl of Chester, from his Earldom of Nottingham.
He followed up his success by compelling the border barons, Roger,
son of Milo, Earl of Hereford, and Hugh Mortimer, a descendant of
the same family as Robert de Belesme, to surrender their fastnesses.
To complete his dominion at home he marched against Malcolm of
Scotland, who was occupying the three Northern counties. These
he compelled him to resign, obliging him to do homage for the county
of Huntingdon, which he claimed as a descendant of the old Earl
Waltheof. Throughout all the earlier part of the reign the Scotch
King appears as a great English baron, following the King to his
wars.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Friendship of
Adrian IV.</div>

<p>Henry even thus early began to think of curbing the overgrown
power of the Church; and Henry of Winchester, in fear of what
might happen, thought it better to lay aside his episcopal robes and
retire for a time to Clugny, from which, however, he was soon induced
to return. An event, indeed, soon occurred which rendered
the King’s position with the Church peculiarly strong.
In 1154 Nicolas Breakspear ascended the Papal throne,
the only Englishman who ever attained that honour. The connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
between England and the Papal See, always close since the
Conquest, was drawn even closer, and the Pope made a grant of the
schismatical country Ireland to the English King; a grant the enjoyment
of which Henry postponed till a more convenient season.
Henry’s widely spread dominions kept him constantly moving, and
in 1156 the affairs of his native county summoned him to France.
He left his kingdom in charge of Robert of Leicester, his great
justiciary.</p>

<p>The difficulty in Anjou arose from the claim raised by his younger
brother Godfrey to that province. This claim rested upon a doubtful
will, by which his father was said to have intended Anjou for
Godfrey if Henry was called to the throne of England. By force of
arms Henry reduced the country; and his brother withdrew on the
receipt of certain payments, being shortly after called by the burghers
of Nantes to become lord of their town. This affair was scarcely
settled when Henry hurried back to England, there to complete his
conquest of the Scotch King, by obliging him to surrender his strong
castles of Bamborough, Newcastle and Carlisle, and again to do
homage for Huntingdon, on which occasion, however, the clause
“Salvis omnibus dignitatibus suis” was introduced into his oath.
This, with the surrender of castles by Hugh Bigod in Norfolk, and
of William, called of Warrenne, son of the late King, and Earl of
Surrey, completed the subjugation of the feudal nobles, and rendered
him absolute master of England.</p>

</div>

<p>Wales alone gave him further trouble. Thither, in 1157, he led an
army against Owen Gwynneth at the instigation of his
fugitive brother Cadwallader. The expedition was not
successful; on this, as on subsequent occasions, Henry
found it impossible to reduce the Welsh in their mountain strongholds.
It is noteworthy, as affording the first instance of scutage, or money
payment in exchange for personal service, which was in this instance
demanded of knights holding from the clergy; and for the shameful
flight of Henry de Essex, the royal standard-bearer, which gave rise
afterwards to a remarkable judicial duel. In the year 1163 Robert
de Montfort impeached Henry de Essex for cowardice and treachery.
The matter came to the ordeal of battle, and Essex being conquered,
forfeited all his lands, and retired as a monk to the Abbey of Reading.
This, and the confiscation of the property of Peveril, already mentioned,
are the only two instances of confiscation during the reign.</p>

<p>It was during this prosperous period of the King’s reign that
Thomas à Becket becomes prominent. The son of a citizen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
London, his talents had been early seen and employed by Archbishop
Theobald. In 1143 he had succeeded in getting
for his patron the legatine authority over England, and
afterwards that Papal bull which prevented the crowning of King
Stephen’s son Eustace. He was richly rewarded by livings in the
Dioceses of Oxford, London, and Lincoln, and, in 1154, with the position
of Archdeacon of Canterbury. The recommendation of the
Primate soon placed him about Henry’s court. He was appointed
chancellor, and as such was the chief clerk of the Curia Regis, kept
the King’s seal, and had the management of vacant ecclesiastical
benefices. He was further intrusted with the guardianship of the
Tower of London, and with the castle of Eye in Berkhampstead, thus
occupying a position partly secular, partly ecclesiastical. In this
situation he exhibited all the splendour of a great noble; kept a
magnificent table, followed the sports of the field, and was a proficient
in knightly exercises. Henry found much pleasure in his
society, and employed him in delicate negotiations. Thus,
in the year 1158, he was sent to arrange a match
between Margaret of France and Henry’s son Henry.
His magnificent embassy dazzled the eyes of the Frenchmen and
was completely successful. The object of the arrangement was to
win the friendship of Louis, and prevent him from interfering with
the King’s plans on Nantes, where he meant to make good his claim
as successor to his brother Godfrey, who had lately died. A meeting
with Louis was effected on the river Epte. Henry accompanied him
back to Paris, and received from him the child princess, whom he intrusted
to the care of Robert of Neuburg, Justiciary of Normandy.
Strong in this new-formed friendship, Henry found no difficulty in
securing Nantes, and thereby a hold upon Brittany.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Introduction

</div>

<p>In spite however of his apparent agreement with Louis he soon
found himself at open war with him. Queen Eleanor’s
grandfather, on going to the Crusades, had mortgaged
the county of Toulouse to Raymond of St. Gilles. The
mortgage money had not been repaid, as Raymond of St. Gilles still
held the city. This nobleman had married the French King’s sister
Constance. When therefore Henry raised the claim of his wife, the
French King openly adopted the cause of Raymond.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Henry determined
to have recourse to arms, and in 1159 raised an
army for the purpose. The war is interesting, not so
much in itself, as in two or three collateral points connected with it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Thus Malcolm of Scotland came with forty-five ships, and a Welsh
prince likewise joined the army. Again, the presence
of Becket at the head of an unusually well-equipped
body of 700 men is mentioned. He is said to have urged the King
to active measures against the French monarch. But Henry&mdash;who
was surprised at finding his lately made friend in arms against him,
and opposing with all his power a claim he had once himself urged,
and who by no means wished to drive matters to extremity&mdash;showed
some scruple in attacking his suzerain, and contented himself with
gaining his object by laying waste the country and capturing the
castles. At the same time he contracted an engagement between his
son Richard and Berengaria, the daughter of Count Raymond of
Barcelona, the son-in-law of the King of Aragon,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and in fact Governor
of that country. But the most important point
about the war was the introduction of the habit of money
payments in exchange for military service. This measure had been
adopted previously with respect to the Church in the war with
Wales. On the present occasion the sum is said to have amounted
to £180,000.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> There were many advantages in the change. The
King was enabled to hire mercenaries, and dispense with the irregular
services of his feudal followers; he got contributions from the Church
lands, and was enabled to do without the hated tax of the Danegelt,
at the same time that he struck a blow at the military importance of
his feudal barons.</p>

</div>

<p>Thus far the course of Henry’s reign had been one of unbroken
prosperity. He had settled and increased his dominions
both in England and on the Continent, had on the
whole gained in his opposition to his suzerain the King
of France, and had strengthened himself by prudent
marriages for his children. He was henceforward, except for a very
few years, to be plunged in disputes and difficulties. It has been
mentioned that the Church in England had reached a position of
great pre-eminence during the troubled period of Stephen’s reign.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
The policy of the Norman kings had been always to support the
Church to the utmost, to keep on good terms with Rome, but at the
same time to make good the supremacy of the power of the king in
his own dominions. William the Conqueror, it will be remembered,
had entirely separated the spiritual from the temporal jurisdiction.
Before the arrival of the Normans, all offences not strictly ecclesiastical
had been tried and punished in the County and Hundred
courts, where both bishop and aldermen presided side by side. In
withdrawing the bishop from the secular courts, William had desired
to raise the character of the clergy by confining them more completely
to spiritual matters. But an abuse had easily grown up, which produced
a directly opposite effect. As the pretensions of the Church
rose, not only were spiritual questions to be tried in the spiritual
courts, but spiritual men were also withdrawn from the secular
jurisdiction, and the doctrine became prevalent that the cleric
could be only tried by his ecclesiastical superior.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Now ecclesiastical
courts could not inflict corporal punishments. Censures,
excommunications, and penances were their weapons. Consequently
clerks might and did commit every sort of crime without
suffering any punishment. To Henry’s love of justice and order
this was most repugnant. But at the same time that he wished to
curtail the license of the clergy, and to establish the superiority of
the royal jurisdiction, he distinctly upheld the policy of his predecessors
in supporting the Roman See. It was a critical time for
that power. The great Frederick Barbarossa was upon
the throne of Germany and attempting to establish with
regard to himself and the Pope on a larger scale what
Henry was anxious to do in England. With a comprehensive view
of the struggle, he had invited the Kings of England and France to
join him in united action for the establishment of the supremacy of
the secular power. His overtures had not been received; and when,
upon the death of Hadrian, in 1159, after a stormy conclave, the
Italian party elected Rolando Bandinelli, under the title of
Alexander III., and the imperial party Cardinal Octavian, as Victor
IV., the two Western kings gave in their adhesion to Alexander.
When expelled from Italy, they received him with extreme honour
at Chateauroux, where they acted as his grooms, leading his horse
between them. He finally found shelter in the French town of
Sens.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Henry produces
Constitutions of
Clarendon.
1164.</div>
</div>

<p>In 1161, Theobald the Archbishop died, and it seemed to Henry
that the opportunity had arrived for carrying out his
reforming plans. Without difficulty he secured the
election of his Chancellor, believing that he would serve
him still in that capacity. But such were not the views of Becket.
He found himself in a position where he might not only serve but
rival the King, and he at once became the ambitious and fanatical
ecclesiastic. His manner of life was wholly changed, fasts and
penances took the place of his former gaiety; the ostentation which
he still exhibited was for others and not for himself; he scarcely
touched food while his guests were feasting; and poor saints and
beggars took the place of the courtiers who had formerly thronged
his hall. He did not wait to be attacked, but himself began the
quarrel with the King. He at once insisted on resigning his temporal
offices. He then demanded homage from some barons whom he
declared to be liegemen of the See of Canterbury and not of the King.
He refused in bold outspoken words to pay the usual tax for the
sheriff at a court at Woodstock. But these were only slight
beginnings. A meeting of the clergy was held at Westminster,
and the great subject of ecclesiastical jurisdictions
was raised. A very bad instance had just excited the
King’s attention. A clerk of the name of Philip Brois had committed
a murder and received no punishment. At the assizes of Dunstable,
Simon Fitz-Peter, the King’s Justice, had found him guilty of the
murder, but Becket insisted on his being withdrawn from the secular
jurisdiction, and sentenced him to two years’ loss of his benefice. To
Henry this seemed at once an insult to his authority and a mere
fostering of crime. He determined upon action, and demanded of
the bishops whether they would accept the ancient customs of the
country. Many of the clergy Henry knew he could rely upon, such
for instance as Becket’s old enemy Roger of York, and
Gilbert Foliot, Bishop of London. He did not expect to
meet much opposition anywhere. With much persuasion
Becket certainly accepted the customs. Henry, determined that there
should be no question on this matter, caused these customs to be
drawn up in the form of Constitutions, and presented to a great
council held at Clarendon. There Becket distinctly broke his word
and retracted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Becket refuses
them.</div>

<p>Bishops and laymen, knowing the King’s character, besought Becket
not to risk the fortunes of the Church by further opposition. For a
moment he seemed to yield, but the next day, when his final answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
was to be given, he again refused to sign them. He stated his
objections fully. His arguments were based principally
on the Canon law of Gratian<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and the False Decretals.
The Body of Customs, as presented to him, consisted of sixteen clauses.
By these, which did not pretend to be new legislation, but a recapitulation
of the old practices of the country, the line was sharply drawn
between criminal and ecclesiastical cases; the criminal clerk being
amenable to the civil jurisdiction: questions with regard to land
claimed by the clergy were to be referred to a jury: as also cases of crime
where there was no accuser: the King was made the ultimate hearer
of appeals, except by his own special leave: bishops were restrained
from leaving the country without leave, or from excommunicating
the King’s men: elections to bishoprics were to be held in the King’s
chapel, in the presence and with the consent of those whom he should
summon: and the newly-elected officer was to swear fealty to the King.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
Other minor matters with regard to the position of the Church were
also settled, but it is these chiefly which were to secure the supremacy
of the crown. Becket is said to have particularly objected to any
subordination of clerks to secular jurisdiction; to have held that
one punishment for one offence was enough, and that the Church
should look to; and to have regarded with displeasure any restrictions
laid upon the right of clerical jurisdiction or excommunication.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
Ultimately, however, he was certainly induced to accept and
to seal them. On retiring from the council he at once began to show
signs of repentance, and got absolution for what he had done from
the Pope.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Becket leaves

</div>

<p>Alexander’s position was peculiar, and, as in the case of Anselm, it
was too important to him in his present difficulties to
retain the friendship of England for him to allow himself
to side very strongly with Becket. Throughout the
quarrel it is the Archbishop who urges the Pope onward, and not the
Pope the Archbishop. Such lukewarmness suited neither party, and
Henry summoned another council for 8th of October at Northampton.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Two days before the council the Archbishop arrived. He did not
receive the kiss of peace, and it was plain that matters
were coming to extremities. Again the Archbishop
began the attack. He lodged some complaint against a
nobleman, and had justice promised him; but was then in his turn
charged with delaying justice, in the case of an official of the Treasury
called John the Marshall, who demanded a piece of land in his court.
Marshall summoned him before the royal court, and he was now told
that the case would come on before the council on the following day.
On that day therefore the court sat in judgment upon
the Archbishop. He was found guilty. The extreme
penalty, which would have been the seizure of all his moveables, was
remitted, and a heavy fine of £500 substituted. No sooner was this
charge finished than a fresh charge was brought against him, and £300
demanded of him, which he had borrowed upon the castles of Eye
and Berkhampstead. On the following day a sum of 500 marks,
which he had borrowed for the expedition to Toulouse on the King’s
security, was demanded. Becket declared it was a gift.
He found fresh securities, and retired in dudgeon. He
found his hall deserted by the knights and barons.
Then followed the final blow. As chancellor he had had the administration
of vacant ecclesiastical and baronial benefices; and now he
was ordered to account for a sum of not less than 30,000 marks.
On accepting the bishopric, he had been discharged from all liability
by Prince Henry and Richard de Lucy the Justiciary. The demand
was manifestly an unjust one, and the greater part of the bishops
appealed against it. The temporal nobles refused to allow the
appeal, as it had yet to be proved that the King was a party to the
discharge. Sickness kept the Archbishop confined to his house for some
days. Meanwhile the bishops attempted to make him yield, and
finally for the most part deserted him, and betook themselves to the
court. The Archbishop was determined to meet the charge in all the
magnificence of his office, and went to the council with his cross and
other insignia. The bishops, overawed by this unusual demonstration,
which they regarded as a challenge to the King, went to him,
leaving the accused Archbishop sitting alone with a few friends.
They tried in vain to get the King’s demand lessened, and changed
for the fine usual in Kent, which was only forty shillings. Henry,
in wrath, merely asked whether the Archbishop had made up his mind
to accept the Constitutions. Becket refused to plead upon any charge
except that of John the Marshall, and at length openly declared that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
he placed himself and the Church under the guardianship of the Pope
and of God. The disturbance was great. The King wished the bishops
to declare the sentence. They earnestly entreated not to be called upon
to judge their superior, and finally the duty was left to Robert of
Leicester the Justiciary. But the Archbishop would not let him speak.
“How can you judge me who appeal to a higher power? And do
not thou Earl of Leicester venture to judge thy spiritual father!”
He rose, and, leaning on his cross, swept from the hall. As cries of
“traitor” arose behind him, his old worldly vehemence got the better
of him, and he turned and cried, “Might I but wear weapons, I should
soon know how to clear myself of the charge of treason.”
As he passed on his way through the streets people knelt
and demanded his blessing. A final answer was required
of him the following day, but in the night, in the midst of wild
weather, he secretly left Northampton, and after a difficult flight, on
the 2nd of November contrived to cross to Gravelines.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He is received
by the Pope.
1165.</div>

<p>On the very same night, an embassy, consisting of his chief enemies&mdash;the
Bishops of York, London, Exeter, Chichester and Worcester,
together with John of Oxford, the King’s chief adviser in this matter,&mdash;crossed
to seek the Pope. The Archbishop put himself under the
protection of the King of France at Soissons; and the two parties
carried their case before the Pope at Sens, where John of Salisbury,
Becket’s emissary, had already been winning him friends. The
King’s embassy entreated that legates might be sent to finish the
case in England. But Alexander, although the Peter’s Pence from
England were absolutely necessary to him, refused their request.
Upon receipt of this information, the King drove abroad
all friends and dependants of the Archbishop, who had
succeeded meanwhile in getting a favourable reception
from Alexander. Till 1170 he remained abroad, carrying on his
struggle with the King.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But Henry
refuses to
oppose
Alexander.</div>

<p>Of course, during that time Henry could not afford to let his other
business rest. But it is the quarrel with the Archbishop which gives
its complexion to the history of those years. In 1165 the Pope was
enabled to return to Italy, but Frederick of Germany, still refusing to
acknowledge him, at an Assembly at Wurtzburg caused Cardinal
Guido to be elected under the title of Pascal III. in the place of
Octavian, who was just dead. Henry seized the opportunity. He
had already forbidden all intercourse between England and the Pope,
and he now despatched an embassy, headed by John of Oxford and
Richard of Winchester, to attempt to act in consort with Frederick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
This was in reply to a demand on the part of the Emperor, who had
sent his chancellor, Reginald of Cologne, to ask for two
of Henry’s daughters in marriage, the one for his son,
the other for Henry the Lion of Saxony. The ambassadors
declared that there were fifty bishops ready to accept the anti-pope.
However, matters did not reach this point: Alexander still
temporized. The clergy of England were very averse to deserting the
legitimate Pope, and the old policy of the Norman kings had yet a
strong hold upon Henry.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Meanwhile he
attacks Wales,
and secures
Brittany.
1166.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Becket
excommunicates
his enemies.</div>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile, leaving the quarrel in abeyance, he again invaded
Wales, again without much success. He was more successful
in the following year in his designs on Brittany.
“He dealt,” says the Chronicler,<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> “with the nobles of the
district of Le Mans according to his pleasure, and the
region of Brittany, and with their castles....” A treaty of marriage
between his son Geoffrey, and Constance, the daughter of Conan of
Brittany and Richmond, having been entered into, this Earl made a
grant to him of the whole of Brittany, with the exception of Guingamp,
which had descended to him from his grandfather. The King
received the homage of all the barons of Brittany at Thouars.
Thence he came to Rennes, and by taking possession of that city, the
capital of Brittany, he became lord of the whole duchy. While thus
triumphing, he received news that Becket, weary of the Pope’s procrastination,
had gone to the Church at Vezelay, and there, after
explaining the Constitutions of Clarendon, had excommunicated
John of Oxford, Richard of Ilchester, and
Richard de Lucy, the King’s Counsellors, and Joscelin of
Balliol, and Ranulph de Broc, who had entered into possession of his
confiscated estates. This step caused considerable anxiety, and the
bishops and abbots of England met and appealed to the Pope, thus
postponing the execution of the excommunication. The Archbishop,
in reply, bid them carry the excommunication at once into effect, and
at the same time excommunicated Godfrey Ridel, the Archdeacon
of Canterbury, for not remitting to him the income of his see. In
anger, the King threatened to expel from England the whole Cistercian
order, as a punishment for allowing the Archbishop to dwell in
their monastery. To avoid this, Becket withdrew to Sens.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Pope
temporizes.</div>

<p>The appeal however went on, and, to the surprise of every one, the
Pope, who had perhaps been bribed, at length appointed
legates to examine the dispute. In 1167, John of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Oxford, the King’s ambassador, came home in triumph, declaring that
the excommunications had been removed. Naturally therefore
Becket dreaded the approach of the legates. By means of his
influence with the French many obstacles were thrown in their way,
and as a fresh declaration that his views were unchanged, he excommunicated
Gilbert of London. At length the legates obtained meetings
both with Becket and Henry. In neither instance were they
satisfactory. Becket refused to withdraw the convenient words
“saving our order,” and Henry would hear of no half measures.
However, their temper was on the whole conciliatory, and they
removed the excommunications conditionally. This friendly feeling
on the part of the Pope was still further shown by his suspending the
Archbishop for a time from the exercise of his office. In fact, the
Pope had just been driven from Rome by Barbarossa, and Henry’s
support was indispensable to him. All this made no difference to
Becket, who, on Palm Sunday, repeated his excommunications, and
contrived at length to get them smuggled over into England, where,
with striking effect, Gilbert of London was suddenly suspended in the
midst of the celebration of mass in his own church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Critical
position
of Henry.</div>

<p>The political difficulties under which Henry was at this time
struggling may have given fresh courage to the Archbishop,
for, both during 1167 and 1168, there was war
with Louis of France and with his other neighbours. The Count
of Flanders was even threatening a descent on England, while the
Counts of Marche, Angoulême, and Limousin, counting on the succour
of the French, were laying waste Henry’s southern dominions. This
difficulty he left in the hands of his General, Count Patrick of
Salisbury, while he himself was called upon to suppress disturbances
in Brittany. His fortunes were indeed at a very low ebb. In presence
of these difficulties, Henry found it necessary to lower his tone;
a peace with his enemies was patched up at Montmirail. There too
a commission from the Pope awaited him, and he found himself
obliged to consent virtually to the demands of Becket. As however
he refused to give his refractory Archbishop the kiss of peace, which
was regarded as the only sure sign of reconciliation, the quarrel was
not yet terminated. Although the point at issue was a small one,
both parties continued obstinate.</p>

</div>

<p>Henry, determined to show his authority, caused his son Henry to
be crowned in England by the Archbishop of York.
This was a distinct invasion of the rights of the Archbishop
of Canterbury, for the coronation was performed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
in the southern province. It produced so great an outcry, that
Henry felt he had gone too far, especially as he had neglected to have
Henry’s wife, the French princess, crowned with him, which Louis
regarded as a great insult. With this feeling against him, Henry
consented to a meeting at Fretheval, and there yielded
what was required of him, embracing the Archbishop,
raising him from the ground, when he knelt before him,
and holding his stirrup for him to remount. The quarrel seemed
ended, but some slight delays occurred before Becket could return to
England, and more than one warning message was sent to him that
England was no safe place for him. When he demanded a safe conduct
from Henry, it did not promise any true reconciliation that
John of Oxford was sent as his escort. He ventured
however, but found the feeling in England, among the
laity at all events, very strong against him, and was
bidden to withdraw to his city of Canterbury. Although conscious of
the power of his enemies, he continued his obstinate course, excommunicated
the Archbishop of York, De Broc, and other lay holders of
the property of the See, whom he found it difficult to dispossess.
When the King heard of this conduct, the anger which had been
boiling within him, but which circumstances had obliged him to suppress,
broke loose, and he accused his courtiers of caring nothing for
him since they suffered this audacious priest to live. Four knights
took him at his word, hurried across to England, collected followers
among his enemies, and proceeding to Canterbury, demanded the
immediate removal of the excommunication. The monks in terror
hurried the Archbishop to the Cathedral, and wished to shut the doors,
believing him then in safe sanctuary, but he would not allow any
sign of weakness. Headed by the knights, the armed
mob broke in, still demanded the removal of the excommunication,
were still refused, and killed him at the altar.</p>

<p>The outcry which rose throughout Europe told Henry that he had
lost his cause. He at once declared himself innocent, refused food,
took on him all the outward signs of penitence, and despatched a
mission to exculpate him at the court of the Pope. Though
Alexander was very angry, he was persuaded to send legates for a
formal inquiry. Henry did not await their coming, but as a means
of employment and retirement, proceeded to carry out an intention
he had long had of conquering Ireland.</p>

<p>His opportunity there indeed had fully come. The country,
divided among petty chieftains, had from time to time been gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
under the command of one chief king. When his authority was at
all strong, some little order existed; when he was
weak, wild disorder reigned. The present holder of
that position was Roderic O’Connor of Connaught.
In 1153, Diarmid, or Dermot, King of Leinster, had carried off
the wife of O’Ruark, Prince of Breffni, or Leitrim. When
O’Connor gained the crown of Tara in 1166, he proceeded to punish
the offender who fled to England, and, collecting
round him some Welsh adventurers, returned home.
Still unable to cope with his enemies, he sought Henry in Guienne,
did homage to him, and received leave to collect an army in
England. In 1169, the half-brothers Robert Fitz-Stephen and
Maurice Fitz-Gerald crossed over to Wexford. This advance-guard
was followed by a stronger party of Welshmen under Richard of
Clare, Count of Strigul, surnamed Strongbow, who, deeply in debt,
had lost his possessions in England, and was glad to seek
some elsewhere. He took Waterford, and married Eva,
Dermot’s daughter; while Dublin, which belonged to the
Danes who had settled in Ireland, was captured by Milo of Cogan. In
1171 Dermot died, and Strongbow succeeded to the crown of Leitrim as
his heir. Henry was not pleased with the rapid success of his vassal,
and proceeded to deprive him of his English property. In vain were
ambassadors sent to the King; he refused them admittance. It was
only when the Earl surrendered Waterford, Dublin, and his other
castles, to the King, that Henry secured to him his other conquests.
Matters were in this condition when Henry determined himself to visit
Ireland. After a month spent in preparation, he reached
Waterford with a fleet of 400 ships in October. Here
Strongbow did homage to him for Leinster, and several
Irish princes acknowledged him for their chief. From Roderic
O’Connor he had to be contented with such slight acknowledgment as
the acceptance of his envoys, De Lacey and William Fitz-Aldelm, might
imply. With the Church he was more successful. All the archbishops
and bishops took the oath of fealty. At a synod held at
Cashel the Roman discipline was introduced; and in 1174,
bulls from Rome, authorizing the collection of Peter’s
Pence and the conquest of the country, were received and accepted.
In a wooden palace, built outside the walls of Dublin, Henry
exhibited the splendours of the English crown, and granted out the
conquered lands to his vassals. Hugh de Lacey received the Earldom of
Meath, and was made Viceroy; Fitz-Bernard received Waterford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
De Courcey and others were instructed to carry on the work of
conquest; and English colonists were placed in Dublin and other
devastated towns. Having made these arrangements, Henry returned
to Normandy, where his presence was much required. But his conquest
was by no means completed; disturbances arose at once upon
his departure; nor was it till 1175 that Roderic was subdued. He then
sent delegates to make his submission to the King at a council held at
Windsor. A treaty was arranged, which acknowledged him as chief
of all the Irish princes, with the exception of Henry and his knights.
He consented to pay a yearly tribute. But except in the conquered
countries, Irish law (the Brehon law as it was termed) held good
throughout Ireland, and English law only within those provinces which
had been thoroughly subdued and were called the English Pale.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry’s
reconciliation
with Rome.
1172.</div>

<p>It was partly to meet the Papal legates that Henry returned from
Ireland. He met them at Avranches, and there swore
that he had nothing to do with the murder of the Archbishop,
and promised adhesion to Pope Alexander in
opposition to the German anti-pope, free intercourse with Rome, the
abrogation of the Constitutions of Clarendon, and personal attendance
at a crusade, either in the East or in Spain, within three years, meanwhile
paying the Templars to undertake this duty for him. Although
this seemed a complete submission, it in fact left the question of the
supremacy of the civil power open.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Henry’s complete

</div>

<p>All his dominions seemed now at peace, but a great danger was
brewing. His son Henry, since his coronation, had already, at the
instigation of the French King, his father-in-law, demanded the actual
possession of some portion at least of his kingdom, and this combination
caused him well-grounded apprehension. He took the opportunity
of the general peace of his kingdom to negotiate a marriage for
his son John with the daughter of Count Humbolt of Savoy, and promised
to give with him as her dowry Chinon, Loudon, and Mirabeau.
The young king Henry protested against this treaty, and suddenly
disappearing from court, took refuge with Louis VII. at
St. Denis. The old king understood only too well what
this meant. Shortly, there was a universal insurrection throughout
all his dominions. It is not difficult to understand. His domestic
relations were not happy, although he was very fond of his children;
his wife was constantly urging them to disobedience. His dominions
were widespread, and consisted of various races; his hand was heavy
upon the feudal nobility, when the English nobles had not yet forgotten
the charms of the late reign; while the defeat which the King had sustained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
in his quarrel with Becket gave a false impression of his weakness.
The discontent was very general. While Louis recognized the
young Henry as the rightful king, and entered into his quarrel in
company with the Counts of Blois, Boulogne, Flanders, and others,
the nobles of Aquitaine rose in insurrection, the princes Richard and
Geoffrey made common cause with the insurgents, William the
Lion of Scotland was engaged to take part with them, and the great
Earls of the middle and north of England, Leicester, Ferrars of Derby,
Chester, and Bigod, joined in the general alliance. Henry, though
alarmed, did not despair. His policy had led him to trust much to
his auxiliaries, and with these he determined to withstand the feudal
malcontents. Leaving his generals to resist the attack from Flanders
and France, he won a great battle before Dol in Brittany, took the
great Earl of Chester prisoner, and re-established his power in that
province. Meanwhile, Leicester had been besieged by Lucy, his
justiciary in England; the efforts of William the Lion, who demanded
Northumberland and refused homage for Huntingdon, were thwarted
by the brave defence of the border castles; and an invasion of
Flemings from the East, headed by the Earl of Leicester, was defeated
at Farnham, near Bury St. Edmunds. But the existing truce with
France terminated at Easter; the king of that country was able to
enter actively into the war; and Henry’s successes, and the large offers
he made his sons, seemed alike unavailing. Hostilities began again,
and Henry was obliged to take the command in person in his hereditary
provinces, Maine and Anjou, where he was received with
enthusiasm. The troops of his son Richard were conquered; while
in England the King’s natural son, Geoffrey Plantagenet, and Richard
de Lucy, made head against the nobles in the East and a fresh invasion
from Scotland; but were still so pressed, that
messengers were sent in haste to summon Henry across
the Channel. It was indeed a moment of great danger.
Philip of Flanders and his allies, to whom Kent had been promised,
were assembling a fleet at Whitsand; the Scotch invaders had reached
Alnwick. Henry hastened home. But before he proceeded
to active measures, in deference to the popular
feeling, which attributed his difficulties to the Divine anger at Becket’s
death, he made a pilgrimage and did penance at the shrine of the
martyr. Immediately after this while still in anxious
doubt as to the fate of his kingdom, news was brought
him that Ranulf de Glanvill had surprised the Scotch at
Alnwick, and that William the Lion and many of his nobility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
were prisoners. A few days afterwards the town of Huntingdon
was taken, and Hugh, the Bishop of Durham, who had joined the
insurgents, conquered. By July all the English nobles had returned
to their allegiance, and Prince David had withdrawn the Scotch
troops. The same rapidity which saved England saved
Normandy also. The sudden arrival of the King before
Rouen raised the siege of that place, which had been hard pressed,
and before long a peace between Henry and Louis was made, by
which all the French conquests were restored, and the young King
Henry’s dependants had to abjure the fealty which they had taken
to him. The great insurrection which for a moment had threatened
the existence of Henry’s monarchy was thus over. To his sons
Henry was merciful. To Richard he granted two castles in Poitou,
with half its revenues; to Geoffrey, similar terms in Brittany. They
were required to renew their allegiance. William of Scotland was
forced to content himself with harder terms. He was only released
upon condition of appearing at York in the following year
with all his barons, and swearing fealty to Henry as his suzerain.
He and his brother did homage for Scotland, for Galloway, and
for their English possessions; while the Scotch clergy acknowledged
the supremacy of the Archbishop of York. In the following year
the young Henry left his French patron and reconciled himself completely
with his father.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Small diminution
of Henry’s
power, either
temporal or
ecclesiastical.</div>

<p>This outbreak may be regarded as a consequence of Henry’s defeat in
his dispute with Becket. The King had shown how little that defeat
had weakened his real power in temporal matters. His
appointments to the vacant bishoprics, which were a
necessary consequence of the termination of that quarrel,
prove how little he had really lost even in
influence. Of the six bishoprics which were filled up, three were
given to avowed partisans of the King. Winchester fell to Richard
of Ilchester; Ely, to Godfrey Ridel, Becket’s great opponent; and
Lincoln to Geoffrey Plantagenet; while, shortly after, the Bishopric
of Norwich was given to John of Oxford, who had been Henry’s chief
agent throughout the Becket difficulty. Such disputes as still existed
in the Church ceased to have political meaning, and assumed the
form of quarrels between the monks and the secular clergy. It was
thus that Richard, the Prior of Dover, a man in the royal interests,
was elected to succeed Becket after a lengthened dispute between the
monks of the Holy Trinity at Canterbury, who claimed the right of
election, and the other bishops of the province. Henry’s influence was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
naturally employed in favour of the episcopal candidate, but he contrived
to confine the dispute within the limits of the ecclesiastical body.</p>

sons is the period of his greatest power. It is at this time that we
find the greatest marks of his activity as a lawgiver. The year 1176
is marked by the great Assize of Northampton, an expansion
of a similar Assize of Clarendon in the year
1166, the fruit perhaps of his experience in the late rebellion,
and the knowledge gained by his inquiries into the conduct
of the sheriffs in 1170. That inquiry, which was called for by the
complaints of the exactions of the sheriffs, proved to him that their
conduct had not been free from peculation, and led him to believe
that the employment of local nobles as his chief officials was dangerous.
He took the opportunity of making a general examination
of the judicial system of the country, the fruit of which was the concentration
and organization of the Curia Regis, and the
arrangements embodied in the Assize of Northampton.
The King’s court consisted originally, as has been already mentioned,
of all those tenants who held their land direct from the crown
(tenants <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in capite</i>), and was the ordinary feudal court, and the natural
parent of our present Parliament, and especially of the House of
Lords. But for the ordinary despatch of business, whether judicial
or financial, what may be regarded as a permanent committee of this
body of immediate holders was employed. This committee consisted
of the great officers of the household, such as the chancellor, treasurer,
marshal and others, and other selected barons closely connected with
the royal household. The head of this committee, or Curia Regis,
was the great justiciary, the King’s representative. The royal chaplains
or clerks were formed into a body of secretaries, at the head of
which was the chancellor. The Curia Regis at first attended the
King and had a twofold duty; when they sat as judges its members
were called justices, in financial questions they sat in the exchequer<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
chamber, and were called barons. This administrative system, which
had been organized in Henry I.’s reign, was entirely destroyed by the
wild reign of Stephen. Its reconstitution was the great work of Henry
II. In the earlier part of his reign the visitations were renewed upon
the old system, the itinerant justice being usually either
the great justiciary, chancellor, or some other great
household officer. In the year 1168 four barons of the exchequer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
performed this duty; in 1176 the country was divided into six circuits.
This number was not permanent, several alterations were
made in it. Nor was the number of visitations thoroughly established.
By Magna Charta in John’s reign commissions are promised
four times a year, but shortly afterwards it would seem that the
general journey of the itinerant justices was every seven years, until
the reign of Edward I. It is to be remembered that these visitations
were for all sorts of objects; for hearing civil cases, for inspecting the
working of criminal jurisdiction, and, perhaps before all things, for
arranging the financial matters of the country, and superintending the
sheriffs in all matters connected with the exchequer. The itinerant
justices during their circuits superseded the sheriff’s authority and
presided in his courts. They were also allowed to enter and preside
in the baronial courts. It has been mentioned that these courts were
in most respects complete Hundreds. The two parallel systems, now on
certain occasions presided over by the same official, were thus assimilated
and brought into immediate connection with the central authority.
This administrative organization gave rise to what is of much political
importance, a new class of barons, new men who had risen by their
talents and by the King’s favour, whose interests were therefore on
the side of order and of the crown. At one period, in 1178, Henry
II. appears to have found his new ministers untrustworthy, at all
events in that year he restricted the Curia Regis to five persons,
keeping the highest appellate jurisdiction in the hands of himself and
the old Curia Regis, which may henceforth be regarded as the King’s
<em>ordinary council</em>. The name Curia Regis has thus passed through
three phases; a feudal court, a permanent committee of the feudal
court, and a restricted committee of that committee. In these various
bodies we have the sources of all the judicial bodies in England.
The feudal court, with certain additions, became the Parliament;
without those additions the Great Council, retaining its natural prerogative
of final court of appeal, and represented now by the House
of Lords. The permanent committee, or ordinary council, is represented
by the privy council, still retaining some of its judicial powers.
From its body of clerks, headed by the chancellor, arose the courts of
Chancery. While the limited committee was divided shortly after
the Magna Charta into three courts, the exchequer, the common
pleas, and the king’s bench, at first with the same judges for all, but
by the end of Edward III.’s reign with a separate staff.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin of jury.</div>

<p>Henry’s legal mind, which thus organized the administration,
introduced many improvements In judicial procedure. It is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
this reign that can be traced the origin of trial by jury. This
method was not employed first in criminal cases, but
in carrying out inquiries of various kinds. As soon
as such inquiries came to be made on oath, the beginning of the
jury system had arrived. As early as the great Domesday survey,
the sheriff, barons, freeholders, the priest, the reeve, and six
villeins of each township, had been all examined upon oath. Judicially
this method of inquiry was first applied in civil cases. By
the ordinance of the Grand Assize, a choice was given to any person
whose right to the possession of land was called in question. He
might either if he pleased defend his claims by the old-fashioned
appeal to battle, or he might have his right examined by twelve freeholders
on their oath, selected by four freeholders also on their oath,
nominated by the sheriff. These sworn freeholders were evidently
at first witnesses; twelve others were subsequently added to them,
who, from their neighbourhood or other reasons, might be supposed
to be better acquainted with the facts. This took place in Edward
I.’s reign. The double jury was then separated, the original twelve
playing their part as jurors of the present day, judging of the facts
asserted by the second twelve, who represent the witnesses. In 1166,
by the Assize of Clarendon, the same process was extended to
criminal cases; that is to say, twelve lawful men from each hundred,
and four from each township, were sworn to inquire whether there were
any criminal, or receiver of criminals, in their district, and to present
the same to the itinerant justices or to the sheriffs. These criminals
were then put to the ordeal without further investigation. This was
the origin of the grand jury. The abolition of ordeal rendered some
substitute necessary, and ordinary trial by jury was the consequence.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Scutage.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Assize of arms.</div>
</div>

<p>The Assize of Northampton in 1176 was, as has been said, a repetition
in stronger terms of the Assize of Clarendon. It is moreover
interesting, as giving a notion of the duties of the itinerant
justices, who on this occasion were six in number. Not only
was the examination of crimes in their hands, but they had to
arrange the law with regard to tenure of land, reliefs of heirs,
dowers of widows, and other such matters, and to exact fealty from
all classes of the commonwealth, and to see to the complete destruction
of private castles, and the secure guardianship of those
of the crown. These latter points were probably rendered necessary
by the Rebellion of 1174. The same feeling of mistrust of his
feudal barons which dictated these precautions was the cause of two
other measures of this reign. The military service of the tenants in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
chief was changed into a money payment called scutage. This
money enabled the King to hire men for his foreign
wars, and to dispense with the service of his barons;
while, by the Assize of Arms in 1181, the national militia of
England, the old <em>fyrd</em> of the Saxons, to follow which
was one of the duties of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trinoda necessitas</i>, was
reorganized, and the arms required of each class in the country
carefully defined.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Henry’s
importance
in Europe.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Closing troubles
with his sons
and France.</div>
</div>

<p>At the same time that Henry was thus organizing his authority in
England, his position in Europe was a great one. Two
of his sons were married or betrothed to daughters of the
King of France. Of his three daughters, the eldest was
the wife of Henry the Lion of Saxony, the rival of Frederick Barbarossa;
the second, Eleanor, was Queen of Castile; the third,
Joanna, though still a child, was taken to Sicily as the bride of
the Norman king of that country, which at this time was the
dominant power of the Mediterranean. His importance indeed was
such that he seemed of all the kings in Europe most firmly seated on
his throne, and was selected on account of his power and character, as
well as for family reasons, as arbitrator between Alphonso of Castile
and his uncle Sancho of Navarre, and as the strongest ally to whom
Henry the Lion could have recourse when he was stripped of his German
possessions. This befell him in consequence of his desertion of
Frederick Barbarossa before his invasion of Lombardy, which terminated
in the great battle of Legnano. But in the midst of his
greatness there were two dangers constantly besetting Henry; on the
one hand was the King of France, on the other were his own children.
Not only did the great power of a feudatory naturally excite the
French King’s jealousy, Henry had pursued a crooked policy with
regard to the marriage of his sons; he had refused to
surrender to Louis the Vexin and Bourges as he had
promised to do upon their marriages. There was thus a
constant opportunity for quarrel. On the other hand, with regard
to his sons, his measures had been still more unfortunate. Anxious
to secure his succession, and conscious probably that his kingdom was
too large to be held by one hand, he had caused his eldest son to be
crowned, thus exciting the envy of his brothers; while, at the same
time, he had given them large duchies, which rendered them nearly
independent of him. In addition to this, his dislike for his wife had
rendered her a constant enemy, while his foolish affection for his
youngest son John gave still further cause of offence. When therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
as was likely to happen, any of his sons determined to oppose
him, they were certain of assistance from France, and of bad advice
from their mother.</p>

<div class="sidenote">First war;
against young
Henry.
1183.</div>

<p>It is difficult to arrange the constant brief wars which characterized
the close of his reign, complicated as they are by the rising interests in
the affairs of the East, which were gradually bringing on the third
Crusade. They may perhaps be divided into four; the first extending
to the death of young Henry; the second to the death of Geoffrey of
Brittany; the third from 1184 to a peace negotiated in the interests of
the crusades in 1188; and the last, the quarrel with Richard and John,
which terminated with the King’s death. The first of these broke out
in 1183. Richard had entered with zest into the wild
feudal life of Poitou and Aquitaine, and had been very
successful there. He had even pushed his arms to
Bayonne, in the territories of the Basques, and to the borders of
Navarre. This had aroused the envy of his elder brother. This
young prince, who regarded himself, and was regarded by many, as
the flower of knighthood, was capable of any amount of hypocrisy
and double dealing, and seems to have so far cajoled his father as to
persuade him to demand from his younger brothers homage to the
elder. This Richard positively refused to give. But his arbitrary
rule in Poitou and Aquitaine had made him many enemies, at the
head of whom was the wild intriguing noble, at once warrior and
troubadour, Bertram de Born. With these young Henry allied himself,
and, with the aid of his brother from Brittany, pressed so heavily
upon Richard, that the old king had to come to his assistance. At
this crisis the young king caught a fever and died, forgiven but unvisited
by his father. The King took advantage of his son’s death
to pursue his success, and succeeded in subjugating the refractory
barons, and re-establishing peace. Conscious that the young King
Philip II. of France, who had succeeded to the throne in 1180, and
over whom he had once had much influence, had been mixed in his
son’s rebellion, Henry tried to make peace with him too. Philip met
the request by a demand for the restitution of Gisors and the dower
of his sister Margaret, young Henry’s widow, and it was with much
difficulty that temporary peace was patched up; but it was finally
arranged that part of the dowry should be restored, and Gisors transferred
to Richard on his marriage with the Princess Alice.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Second war;

1184.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Third war.
1187.</div>
</div>

<p>Constantly unwise in his conduct to his sons, Henry now demanded
from Richard, perhaps as a recompense for his assistance, a part of
Aquitaine, to be given to his favourite son John. This Richard refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
to give, and consequently both John and Geoffrey of Brittany
attacked him. But though Geoffrey was thus ready
enough to quarrel with his elder brother, it was from
no love of his father that he did so. He, as well as
Richard, was hurt by Henry’s evident partiality for John. He
took the opportunity of putting in his own claim for Anjou.
On Henry’s refusal, he at once fled to France, where he was as
usual well received. His death relieved his father for the time
from his opposition, but sowed the seed of further difficulties;
for on the one hand his province Brittany was at once divided
between the French and English faction, and on the
other King Philip II. raised claims as overlord to the
guardianship of his young son Arthur. There was a growing disinclination
however on all sides to plunge into war; for the Pope
was constantly urging a general peace, and the combination of
Christian princes for the great Eastern Crusade. A succession of
weak princes, and the unnatural and artificial character of the feudal
kingdom of Jerusalem, together with the rise of the new Mahomedan
power of the Saracens under Saladin, had reduced European power in
the East to a very low ebb; and in 1184, Heraclius, the Bishop of
Jerusalem, had found it necessary to come over, to attempt to
persuade the Kings of England and France to embark in a new
crusade. But to Henry, although under a pledge to join such an
expedition, the idea of leaving his European dominions in their
present critical situation was very distasteful, and he consequently
postponed taking action. The feeling however that a crusade was
imminent rendered hostilities more difficult; so that when, in 1187,
the arbitrary behaviour of Richard in Aquitaine had produced fresh
difficulties with France, which as usual terminated in the flight of
Richard and the junction of his interests with those of his father,
the news of the great battle of Hettin, in which the flower of the
Christian army of Jerusalem had been entirely destroyed, and the
arrival of William of Tyre for the purpose of exciting the enthusiasm
of the West, put a sudden end to the hostilities; and, in 1188, the
two kings met in perfect friendship under the old elm in the neighbourhood
of Gisors, which was their usual place of treaty, and joined
with apparent heartiness in taking the Cross. Upon this occasion
Henry imposed upon England the tax, known as the Saladin tax,
which was a tenth on all property, and in the collection of which the
King’s officers were to work hand in hand with the Church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Last war; with
Richard and
Philip.
1189.</div>

<p>But nothing could keep the restless Richard in order; before the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
was over, he was engaged in fresh quarrels with Geoffrey of Lusignan
and Raymond of Toulouse. After mutual demands for
the ransom of some captives, Richard advanced in arms
against Raymond, who applied to his suzerain Philip for
assistance. This open attack on his dominions Philip could not put
up with. At length he declared himself the open enemy of the
English. It was in vain that his great feudatories reminded him that
he was under the crusader’s vow, in vain that a meeting was held at
Gisors. The enmity of the kings was only thereby inflamed, and, in
token of his eternal hostility, Philip had the old elm of reconciliation
hewn down. One would have supposed that Richard, the cause of
the quarrel, would have clung to his father; nor is the reason for his
not doing so very plain. Perhaps it may be traced to his father’s
refusal to give him up Alice, the French King’s sister, for his wife,
wishing it is said to make her his own; perhaps it was continued
jealousy of his brother John. Certainly he did betake himself to the
French court, and with him many others of Henry’s French feudatories
fell away. Henry thus found himself in a difficult situation;
broken in mind and body, his resources strained to the utmost by the
late heavy taxation of England, and his nobles rapidly deserting him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry’s
disastrous
peace and death.</div>

<p>His health appears to have influenced his mind. He remained
inactive at Le Mans, while Philip overran Maine and threatened
to besiege Tours. At length Le Mans, where Henry was with his
son Geoffrey, was taken. The city where he had himself
been born was the particular object of Henry’s love.
He felt its loss as a heavy blow, and though he knew his
weakness, could not bring himself to retreat to Normandy, where his
chief strength lay. With a sudden accession of energy, he reappeared
in Anjou. But his appearance had no effect. One by one the fortresses
of Maine were captured, and Philip constantly approached
Tours. When that town fell, Henry’s spirit was quite broken. He
agreed to an interview with Richard and Philip on the plain of
Colombières, to make his submission. Almost fainting, and held
upon his horse by his attendants, in the midst of a violent thunderstorm,
he met his undutiful son, and brought himself to give him the
kiss of peace, whispering as he did so, however, “May God not let me
die until I have taken me due vengeance on thee.” The terms of his
submission were complete. He promised to give up the Princess
Alice; he allowed his nobility to swear fealty for their lands to his
son Richard; he promised to pay Philip 50,000 marks for the restoration
of his conquests. He had asked, in exchange, for a list of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
nobles who had joined Richard in rebellion. When he found at the
head of the list the name of his beloved son John, his heart was
broken. “I care no more for myself nor for the world,” he said. A
day or two longer he lingered, and was carried to Chinon, murmuring
at intervals, “Shame, shame, on a conquered king,” and there died,
attended only by his natural son and Chancellor Geoffrey.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance of
the reign.</div>

<p>It is scarcely possible to place the importance of this reign too high,
or to overvalue the work of Henry II. We find in his
reign the organization of almost all departments of the
government subsequently completed by Edward I. The arrangements
of the Curia Regis and the reforms in judicial procedure have been
already mentioned. The exchequer also was put on a new footing.
It now becomes possible to see with some clearness the sources and
amount of the royal revenue. To the revenues derived from the
domain lands and from the Danegelt, the Norman kings had added
feudal dues. Both the proceeds of the royal domain and of the Danegelt
appear to have been farmed. The farm of the counties amounted
in Henry II.’s reign, after the deductions caused by the grants both
of Stephen and of Henry, to about £8000 a year. The Danegelt,
originally two shillings on every hide, amounted in Henry I.’s reign
to about £2500. As this is about a tenth of what the tax would have
produced had it been fully exacted, it must probably also have been
farmed to the sheriff, who collected what he could of it, and paid a
fixed sum to the exchequer. This unsatisfactory tax came to an end
in Henry II.’s reign, perhaps through the agency of Becket. The
other source of revenue was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Donum</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Auxilium</i>, contributions
paid by vassals to assist their lords. The first term applied to the
counties, the second to the towns. These names became the general
names of all irregular imposts, which are also sometimes called hidage,
scutage, or tallage, the tallage being the aid raised from towns, the
scutage the aid raised from knights’ fees, the hidage the aid raised
from tenants in socage. The importance of the scutage as a commutation
for military service has been already dwelt upon. Recourse appears
to have been had to these scutages only three or four times during the
reign. To these sources of revenue are to be added the fees from the
law courts, and the incomes arising from feudal incidents, such as
wardship, marriage, and reliefs. The whole income of the country
was perhaps about £50,000. The taxes seem to have been assessed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>by Barons of the Exchequer, aided by the declaration of the knights
as to their own holdings, by juries in the case of minor tenants.
But it was not only in details of administration that Henry showed
his character. He constantly summoned great councils, and as his
power was so great and centralized that he could certainly have acted
without them, this appears to show a fixed intention on his part to
assume the position of a national and constitutional king. The
general effect of his work at home was to form the nation. Normans
became English. The English no longer felt themselves a conquered
people. Their oppressors, the feudal nobility, were destroyed or kept
in restraint. The new nobles were chiefly ministers of the crown,
and all sections of the people looked to the King as the national
representative. The importance of Henry’s reign abroad was scarcely
less striking. His immense continental dominions made him one of
the great powers of Europe. His close contact with France, and the
difficulties which it produced, began the hereditary policy of opposition
to that country which has characterized the whole of English
history. On the other hand, though he may have had no clear view
of what he was doing, he set on foot also the lasting friendships of
the nation. The marriage of his daughter with the Guelph Duke
brought England into constant friendship with Germany, and caused
Otho, the son of Henry the Lion, to be brought up in England, and to
be regarded as an English prince. The marriage of his other daughter
with Spain set on foot that connection which lasted even beyond the
Reformation. His work as a whole may be summed up in the words
of Professor Stubbs: “He was faithful to the letter of his engagements.
He recovered the demesne rights of the crown, so that his
royal dignity did not depend for maintenance on constant taxation.
He restored the usurped estates; he destroyed the illegal castles,
and the system which they typified; he maintained the royal hold
on the lawful ones, and the equality and uniformity of justice which
their usurpers had subverted; he restored internal peace, and with it
plenty, as the riches of England in the following reign amply testify.
He arranged the administration of justice by enacting good laws and
appointing faithful judges. He restored the currency; he encouraged
commerce, he maintained the privileges of the towns; and, without
encouraging an aggressive spirit, armed his people for self-defence.
He sustained the form, and somewhat of the spirit of national representation.
The clergy had grounds of complaint against him for
very important reasons; but their chief complaints were caused by
their preference for the immunities of their class to the common safeguard
of justice.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Richard seems
to begin well.<br /><br />
Persecution of
the Jews.</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Richard began his reign with some show of penitence. He
got absolution for his disobedience to his father,
and gave his friendship to the existing ministers, with
the exception of the Seneschal of Anjou and Ranulf de Glanvill.
It is possible that the government of this great justiciary had been
over arbitrary, for in England, where his mother acted principally
for him, Richard is said to have freed all those prisoners who were
confined by the orders of his father or the justiciary, but demanded
bail for those who were legally imprisoned. He also seems to have
punished the severity of some of the sheriffs. His coronation pomp
was interrupted by a strange disturbance. The Jews had been ordered
to absent themselves from the ceremony. This strange people had
been admitted to England by the Conqueror; the only capitalists of
the time, their ability and willingness to lend money rendered them
invaluable both to the rising industry of the country and to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
crown; and to their knowledge is due much of the growth in
science which was beginning to be made in this century. So great
was their use, in spite of the heavy usury they demanded, that they
were allowed to establish themselves in various towns, in districts
known as Jewries, to build synagogues, and follow their own customs.
They were not however admitted to full citizenship. The Jewries,
like the forests, were not under the protection of the common law of
the country, but were entirely in the King’s power. In spite of the
evident advantages derived from their presence in England, their
wealth, their foreign manners, their high usury, and their strange
worship rendered them objects at once of contempt and hatred to the
people. Some of them, in spite of the order forbidding their presence,
showed themselves at the ceremony of the consecration. They were
assaulted by the soldiery. This gave a signal to the
the crowd who attacked the detested people in all parts of
the city. Nor was this all; the same feeling spread throughout
England. In some places the Jews gained safety by conversion; but
early in 1190, in Norwich, in Stamford, and in York, many were
put to death. In the last-mentioned place, the Jews sought refuge
in the castle, and being besieged there, determined to die together.
Firing the tower, they first killed their own women and children,
and then sprang with them into the flames.</p>

<div class="sidenote">All offices put

<p>In fact, the Crusades brought with them a passion for adventure
and licentiousness, as well as religious enthusiasm. This spirit was
now abroad in England, and the King, with his wild love of adventure
at any price, was its fitting representative. For the sake of adventure,
honesty, good government, and national honour, were sacrificed. Thus
there was scarcely an office which was not openly put up
up for sale; cities bought their charters, judges their seats on
the bench, bishops their sees. Thus too Hugh de Pudsey bought the
Earldom of Northumberland for £1000; and Longchamp, the Bishopric
of Ely for £3000; while the King relinquished all the advantages
his father had won over William the Lion of Scotland for 10,000
marks; it was for Huntingdon alone that the Northern King did
fealty to Richard.</p>

<p>Having by such unjustifiable means procured money for his purposes,
entirely regardless of the misery he could scarcely
fail to leave behind him, Richard crossed over to France
to join his forces with those of Philip Augustus. Such
precautions as he did take against maladministration
in England were not of the wisest. He put the whole power into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
hands of William Longchamp, Bishop of Ely, whom he made at once
Chancellor and Chief Justiciary, securing for him also the authority
of Papal Legate. But Longchamp was a man who could not fail to
have many enemies. Of low extraction, and regarded as merely the
favourite of Richard, he was fond of exhibiting his grandeur in the
most ostentatious manner; moreover, in making him justiciary Richard
supplanted Hugh de Pudsey, to whom the office had already been
given. Pudsey did not surrender without some opposition. He
obtained from the King letters patent, naming him justiciary north
of the Humber; when he exhibited these to Longchamp, the Chancellor
contrived indeed to entrap him to London, and there made him
surrender his claims, but he had made himself a powerful enemy for
life. Richard also, as a second precaution, made his brother John, and
his half-brother Geoffrey, who had got the Archbishopric of York in exchange
for the chancellorship, promise not to enter England during his
absence. But he afterwards unwisely absolved John from his vow.
He thus left behind him in England a possible claimant to the succession,
whose power as a baron was very great, for he was the possessor of
Derbyshire, the inheritance of the Earl of Gloucester, which he had
obtained by marriage, and of Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, and Somerset,
which Richard had himself given him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Quarrels with
Philip in Sicily.</div>

<p>The death of William II. of Sicily, and of the French Queen
Isabella, delayed the Crusade till June 1190. But at the end of that
month, the Kings set out towards their first point, which was Sicily,
Philip by Genoa, Richard by Marseilles. At the same time, a fleet of
more than a hundred sail left the harbours of Brittany and Guienne.
On reaching Sicily the friendship of the two kings was
at first most edifying, but it was not long before various
causes of dispute arose between them. To the inhabitants of the
island the Crusaders seemed a horde of new invaders. The overbearing
character of Richard exasperated the feelings of jealousy thus
aroused. The conciliatory manners of Philip, on the other hand, were
such that he was known as the Lamb, in contradistinction to Richard,
who was called the Lion. The difference of feeling with which they
were regarded was plainly shown when, on the occasion of some quarrel,
the town of Messina was closed against Richard, while Philip was admitted
within its walls. The enemies of the French King suggested
indeed that his mildness was a proof of treasonable lukewarmness
towards his fellow Crusaders. These suspicions were afterwards confirmed.
On the death of William II.,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Tancred, an illegitimate son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
William’s brother Roger, had seized the throne, despoiling of her rights
Constance, the daughter of Roger and the wife of Henry VI. of Germany,
and keeping in some sort of confinement Richard’s sister Joanna, the
widow of William the Good, and retaining the dowry secured her
by her husband’s will. The enmity thus excited in Richard’s mind
gave way, after a lengthened dispute, to the natural feeling of friendship
between the two Norman houses. Joanna and her dowry were
given back to Richard; and at one of the meetings between the two
princes, Tancred informed him of a plot on the part of the French to
fall treacherously on the English army. Philip does not seem to
have denied the charge, and it was perhaps the consciousness of his
guilt which prevented him from making any effectual opposition
when Richard repudiated his sister Alice. Contrary to the national
feelings, and on purely political grounds, Richard had been contracted
to this princess by his father. He now, throwing over this unnatural
match, sought for himself a wife from Spain, a country then and for
long afterwards connected by close friendship with England. This
wife was Berengaria, the daughter of Sancho I. of Navarre. Though
unavenged, the insult was felt. From that time onwards Philip and
Richard were enemies.</p>

</div>

<p>At length the armies broke up from Sicily and sailed for Acre.
With the three leading ships of the English fleet were Berengaria and
the King’s sister Joanna. Richard brought up the rear. Two of the
Queen’s vessels were wrecked upon the Isle of Cyprus, and their crew
imprisoned by Isaac, the ruler of that island. This monarch, a
descendant of the Emperor John Comnenus, banished from Byzantium,
had established himself with the title of Emperor in the Isle of
Cyprus. He was an inhuman tyrant, the dread of pilgrims and of
shipwrecked sailors. He tried to entice the two queens to land,
but luckily Richard’s fleet arrived. The Cyprians were driven from
Lymesol, where the King established his court. He
there received Guy of Lusignan, the nominal King
of Jerusalem, completed his marriage with Berengaria,
and made a treaty with Isaac. But when the Emperor sought to
evade his engagements, Richard conquered the rest of the island, and
organized it in the feudal fashion. On the 8th of July he reached
Acre. The arrival of this warlike prince raised the spirit of the
besiegers, who were in a very depressed condition. The siege had
lasted since 1189, having been undertaken by Guy of Lusignan, who
saw the importance of the place, if he was to continue to hold his kingdom.
This was indeed a doubtful question. The Christian fortunes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
had sunk very low. Among the Mahomedans power after power
had arisen with rapid success, and sunk as rapidly under the attacks
of its own slaves or vassals. As the Abbassid Caliphs yielded to the
Seljukian Turks, the Seljukians in their turn yielded to the Atabeks.
The power of this race was brought to its height by Noureddin, who
established his rule at Damascus, and extended it even into Egypt.
Saladin, the son of Ayub, had attended his uncle Shiracouh, when he
destroyed the rule of the Fatimite Caliphs in Egypt, and brought that
province under the power of Noureddin. On Noureddin’s death,
Saladin acquired possession of Egypt, to which he subsequently added
the provinces of Damascus and Aleppo, and raised an empire which
reached from Tripoli in Africa to the Tigris. It was this new warlike
power which had overwhelmed the kingdom of Jerusalem. Baldwin
IV.,<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> King of Jerusalem, became a leper. His sister Sybilla married
Guy of Lusignan, a French prince of weak character, who succeeded to
the throne. His elevation excited the jealousy of Raymond, Count of
Tripoli, the greatest of his vassals. By his treacherous advice, Saladin
attacked Tiberias. To complete his treachery, Raymond persuaded
the Christians to take up a position in a camp destitute of water,
and withdrew with his forces at the moment of attack.
The destruction of the Christians was complete. In a
few months Jerusalem itself was taken, and Tyre and
Tripoli the only places left in Christian hands. Tyre was defended
with success by the bravery of Conrad of Montferrat, who, in consequence
of this success, was regarded as the great champion of the
Christians. He had married a young sister of Sybilla of Lusignan,
and upon the death of Sybilla, holding that the right went to the
living princess, his wife, rather than to Lusignan, the husband of the
dead princess, he demanded the throne. Meanwhile Guy besieged
Acre, thirty miles south of Tyre, and was there surrounded
by an army under the command of Saladin,
and cut off from all assistance except by sea. It was under these
circumstances, in the midst of the disputed succession to the throne,
that the third crusade had begun. Frederick Barbarossa, who had
marched with the Germans by land, perished on the road, and the
Duke of Swabia reached the camp with only five thousand wearied
men. The arrival of the hosts of England and France by sea changed
the aspect of affairs; and the kingdom might have
regained had it not been for the bad feeling which existed
between Richard and Philip, which found new food in the rivalry of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the two claimants for the crown of Jerusalem. Conrad of Montferrat
at once allied himself with the French monarch; Guy of Lusignan,
whose family in Languedoc were English vassals, attached himself to
Richard. Directed by the enthusiasm of Richard, who, whenever
mere fighting was the question, came prominently
forward, the arms of the besiegers were successful, and
Acre fell. The superiority which Richard acquired in actual warfare
added fresh fuel to Philip’s anger. There were besides certain
circumstances in his own kingdom, where he had lately acquired
Flanders, which seemed to require his presence. He therefore
withdrew from the crusade, leaving the Duke of Burgundy with a
part of his army under Richard’s command. Had
Richard been a general as well as a soldier, he had still
forces enough to have brought this crusade to a successful issue. As
it was, it consisted but of a series of brilliant but useless skirmishes.
Even the great battle of Arsouf, which Richard won in September on
his way to Joppa, brought him no nearer his object.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Richard
quarrels with
Austria.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Truce with
Saladin.
1192.</div>
</div>

<p>The presence of Philip in France, in close proximity to his own
dominions, made him wish to be at home; and in 1192 he began
negotiations with Saladin. He might even yet have been successful.
In the course of the year he marched within sight of the Holy City.
But his allies insisted that the capture was impossible,
and he withdrew to Ascalon. There all causes for giving
up his enterprise became stronger. The split with France
widened. He quarrelled deeply with the Archduke of Austria, and
with the faction of Conrad of Montferrat, who was also intriguing
with Saladin. News of the disturbances in his own kingdom reached
him. Everything urged him to go home. He summoned a council
to settle the dispute as to the kingdom, was astonished when Conrad
was named, but unwillingly gave his consent. At this very time,
in what appeared to be only too opportune a moment for Richard,
Conrad was murdered, as there seems no reason to doubt, by two
members of the sect of the Assassins sent by the Old Man of the
Mountain;<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> but the crime was soon fastened upon Richard. For
the present, however, he was free to take advantage of the death of
Montferrat. Sure of the incompetence of Lusignan, he gave the
kingdom to Henry of Champagne. To save appearances, he made one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
more rapid advance towards Jerusalem, but halted within sight of the
city, apparently overborne by the argument that an attack on Egypt
would be more profitable. Hearing that Saladin was besieging
Joppa, he hastened to the relief of that town, and there
won his final victory. Both he and Saladin were worn
in health and weary of the strife. A three years’ truce
was arranged between them. By this it was agreed that Ascalon
should be shared with the Turks, while the Christians should possess
from Joppa to Tyre, the Counts of Tripoli and Antioch should be
included in the treaty, and pilgrims have free access to Jerusalem.
He then set off on his homeward voyage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John’s behavior
in
England.
1191.</div>

<p>It was indeed time for the King to return. Richard had left
William of Ely the chief command both in Church and State. An
ambitious upstart, of ostentatious habits, William speedily roused
against himself the bitterest hatred. He had one dangerous enemy
who could give a voice to this unpopularity. This was the King’s
brother John, who wished to secure what he believed
would be the speedy succession to the throne, while
William sought to give a seeming legality to his
position by upholding the claim of young Arthur of Brittany.
Hence arose two great factions in the kingdom. The King, hearing
in Sicily of the misdeeds of his Chancellor, had commissioned
Archbishop Walter of Rouen, and William, the heir of
Strongbow of Pembroke, if necessary, to remove him from the regency;
at all events to join themselves with him and Fitz-Peter in a committee
of government. Archbishop Walter shrank from the task.
The quarrel came to an issue at Lincoln, which Gerard of Camville held
in the interests of John, and which the Chancellor claimed for the
crown. John seized the royal castles of Nottingham and Tickhill,
and the question was brought before a meeting at Winchester, where
a compromise was effected. A second cause of quarrel occurred, when
the Bishop caused Geoffrey, the King’s natural brother, the new Archbishop
of York, who had landed in England contrary to his oath, to be
apprehended in the very church at Dover. The two brothers made
common cause. They demanded satisfaction for Geoffrey, and summoned
a meeting between Reading and Windsor. Meanwhile the
Chancellor suddenly left Windsor, and shut himself up in the Tower
of London, and the meeting reassembled in St. Paul’s. There all
the charges against the Chancellor were produced; Hugh of Durham
produced his old grievances, Geoffrey of York his late injuries. The
Tower was ill provided with food; the Chancellor was obliged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
appear and to plead; but now at length Richard’s envoys produced
their authority. Longchamp was dismissed from his offices. Walter
of Rouen was put in his place, and the fallen Chancellor took refuge
in France. The Pope received him, and excommunicated his enemies;
but as usual this proceeding, when against the popular feeling, had
but little effect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Return of Philip
Augustus.</div>

<p>Meanwhile Philip Augustus had been returning from the Holy
Land. In December 1192 he reached Paris, and early
in the following year demanded from the Seneschal of
Normandy the restoration of his sister Alice, the Castle of Gisors, and
the towns of Aumale and Eu, which he said that Richard had promised
him. On the refusal of this request he began to tamper with
John, begging him to come to him, when Normandy and England
should be assured to him. John was stopped from immediate action
by the influence of Queen Eleanor, but the disorder in the country
was becoming flagrant. Richard’s French vassals in Aquitaine were
with difficulty suppressed.</p>

<div class="sn-box">

<div class="sidenotex">John and Philip

</div>

<p>It was plain that the return of the King alone could save the
kingdom. Yet those English pilgrims who returned
home before Christmas were surprised to find the King
yet absent. He did not come, and the gloomy news
was at length noised abroad that he was in a dungeon in Germany.
He had attempted to return by sea, but afraid to travel through
France, he had made his way up the Adriatic, intending to cross
Germany to the dominions of his friend and relative the Duke of
Saxony. Travelling in disguise, he had been discovered while in the
Duchy of Austria; and the Archduke, whose anger he had roused at
Ascalon, made him his prisoner. He shortly after sold him to Henry
VI., Emperor of Germany. The capture of the King,
whose name was in every one’s mouth, strongly excited
the feelings of Europe, and steps were immediately
taken for his liberation. But to John his imprisonment served only
as a means of aggrandizement. He hurried abroad, did homage to
Philip, purchasing his favour with Gisors, the Vexin, and with Tours,
and pledging himself not to make peace with his brother without
Philip’s permission. He tried to persuade the English justiciaries
that his brother was dead, and secured, with his auxiliaries,
Wallingford and Windsor. Philip, too, basely took
advantage of his rival’s position, used all his
influence to lengthen his imprisonment, broke off
the feudal connection between them, and invaded his dominions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Richard’s subjects were, however, remarkably true to him. The
justiciaries, assisted by Queen Eleanor, boldly opposed John in England,
and the burghers of Rouen put Philip to a shameful flight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">England
ransoms him.</div>

<p>In Germany Richard did homage to Henry for England. The
connection of England with Germany makes it possible that there
may have been some political meaning in this act. Some general
action against France, or against Apulia, may have been thought of.
But it came to nothing. It was afterwards cancelled by Henry himself,
and has been generally regarded as a mere formality. However
formal the act of homage may have been, Richard was certainly
much connected with the German Empire. He mixed authoritatively
in the next imperial election, after the death of Henry VI. in 1198;
and it was chiefly by his influence that Otho, his nephew, a prince of
the Guelphic royal family, and generally regarded as an English
prince, was elected to succeed him. Of more immediate importance
to England than this connection was the sum of money demanded
for the King’s ransom. The form of a trial was gone through at
Spiers. All the charges which had been brought against him in the
East were repeated;&mdash;his friendship with Tancred, his victory over
Isaac, the murder of Conrad, his insults to Austria, even his final
treaty with Saladin. He replied frankly and eloquently to these
charges, and it was finally agreed that he should be
liberated on the payment of 100,000 marks of silver, and
50,000 additional as a contribution to the Emperor’s proposed march
against Apulia. He was to be liberated as soon as the first sum was
paid; for the payment of the second hostages were to be left. With
considerable difficulty the money was collected, chiefly from the
estates of the Church; and after some further difficulties, caused by
the intrigues of Philip Augustus, in 1194, on the 13th of March the
King landed at Sandwich.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">War with

<div class="sidenotex">Richard’s death
at Chaluz.
1199.</div>
</div>

<p>His appearance in England at once destroyed the influence of John’s
party. Hubert the Justiciary had been doing his best
to suppress it; such castles as still held out surrendered
at the presence of Richard. His residence in England was short.
He caused himself to be re-crowned, to remove the stain of his captivity,
had recourse to his old nefarious means of gathering money,
and then, weary of idleness, crossed into the more troubled country
of France. With Philip it was impossible that he should have peace.
An almost continuous war between the kings occupied
the rest of the reign. Richard never displayed the
talents of a general, and the war dwindled into an uninteresting series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of petty skirmishes. These were usually decided in favour of Richard.
Once, in the year 1196, united action among the enemies of France
seemed to threaten Philip with a heavy blow. Raymond of St. Gilles,
Richard’s old enemy, married his sister, Joanna of Sicily; the Count
of Flanders, the Bretons, and the Count of Champagne joined in the
league; and in the following year, Count Baldwin of Flanders succeeded
in taking Philip prisoner, but he was freed on promising
peace; nor for want of leaders did the alliance get much beyond the
ordinary petty warfare of the time. At length, in 1198, a truce was
patched up by the Papal influence, but before disbanding his troops,
Richard led them to attack the Castle of Chaluz, where the Count of
Limoges was said to be keeping some treasure which the
King claimed. He was there wounded in the shoulder,
as he rode round the walls, and the wound proved fatal.
During his illness the castle was taken, and all the garrison hanged,
with the exception of Bertrand de Gourdon, who had discharged
the fatal arrow. He was reserved for the King’s own judgment.
“What have I done,” asked the King, “that you should take my life?”
“You have killed my father and my two brothers,” answered he,
“and I would willingly bear any torture to see you die.” King
Richard is said, in spite of his merciless temper, to have ordered his
life to be spared. Mercadi, the chief of his mercenaries, was not so
scrupulous; he had him flayed and hanged.</p>

<p>Although the King himself was but a few months in his own
country, the conduct of affairs in England possesses some interest, as
showing the further advance of the administrative system established
by Henry II. After the King’s return from his captivity, and final
triumph over the machinations of John, the kingdom was left in the
hand of Hubert Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury. He had been
trained by Glanvill, and belonged to the class of officials created by
the late King. It was through his activity that, while the ransom
was still being collected, the kingdom was reduced to tranquillity, and
John’s castles captured in the name of the King. On Richard’s withdrawal
to his native dominions, Hubert held the three high offices of
Justiciary, Archbishop, and Papal Legate. The whole government of
the kingdom was virtually in his hands. It was carried on by him
in harmony with the system in which he had been trained; and in
the instructions given to the justices, for a great visitation of the
kingdom in the year 1194, we find the superiority of the central to
the local courts still further increased by an order, that sheriffs should
not act as justices in their own counties. The dangerous power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
these officers was for the time destroyed, when afterwards by the
Magna Charta they were forbidden to hold the pleas of the crown at
all, that is to say, all business in which the crown was interested
was removed from their jurisdiction to that of the central courts.
The demands of Richard for money were incessant. And on one
occasion, when a large carucage, or tax upon every carucate of land,
was demanded, which was in fact a renewal of the Danegelt in
another shape, a fresh survey of the country, established by sworn
and representative witnesses, and very similar to the Domesday
survey, was ordered. In this system of representative inquiry for
financial purposes is to be found the beginning of the representative
system subsequently employed in Parliament. So heavy were the
taxes, that opposition was finally excited, and Hugh of Lincoln
followed the example of Thomas à Becket, and refused payment from
his Church land. It was apparently in connection with this opposition
that Hubert, in 1198, withdrew from his secular work, and was
succeeded by Geoffrey Fitz-Peter. Politically, the strength of the
crown exhibited in these transactions, the very completeness and
excellence of Henry’s system, tended to change the interests of the
various classes in England. The crown, hitherto the champion of
the people against the feudal barons, began to overstrain its power,
and all classes were gradually forced into opposition to it,&mdash;a work
completed by the greater and less glorious tyranny of John, and by
the increased feeling of nationality excited among the barons, when
the loss of Normandy severed them entirely from France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John secures
the crown.</div>

<p class="drop-cap">King Richard had nominated John as his successor, having
never renewed the recognition of Arthur of Brittany which
he had made in Sicily. The new King at once set about securing his
possession. He succeeded in laying hands upon the
treasury at Chinon and the castles of Normandy. In
Brittany, Anjou, Maine, and Touraine, there were signs of opposition.
The barons put forward the claim of Arthur; Constance, his mother,
took the young prince to the court of Philip, and that king proceeded
in his name to master the towns and fortresses. But the assistance
of his mother Eleanor, who had taken possession of her old
inheritance Poitou and Aquitaine, enabled John to make successful
opposition to the invasion, and on the 25th of April he was crowned
at Rouen, and felt himself strong enough to establish his claims in
England. Thither he had already sent the chief of his brother’s
ministers&mdash;Hubert Walter, the Archbishop of Canterbury; Fitz-Peter,
justiciary, and afterwards Earl of Essex; and William Marshall,
Earl of Pembroke. These ministers had already obliged the
nobles to tender their oath of allegiance; and John, on his arrival in
May, was crowned at Westminster, taking the usual oaths to guard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the Church, to do justice, and to repeal bad laws, but giving no
further charter. The Archbishop is said to have begun the coronation
with the declaration that the throne was elective, an assertion
received with acclamation by those who were present. He is said
afterwards to have declared that he took this step, knowing the King’s
character; he was, however, throughout his life a devoted servant of
the crown.</p>

<div class="sn-box">

<div class="sidenotex">His danger

</div>

<p>John’s position at the beginning of his reign was good. He was
accepted in England; he was strong enough to refuse
the Scottish King’s demands on Northumberland and
Cumberland; the Counts of Flanders and Boulogne made offers of
friendship; and Otho of Germany even pressed him not to make
peace with the French king, promising to come to his assistance. It
was from Philip only that he appeared to have to dread any danger;
for that king’s early friendship for him had now changed to hatred,
as he declared because he had accepted his continental dominions
without asking leave of him, his feudal superior. We have thus early
the key to the policy of Philip Augustus, who was determined
to make use of the letter of the feudal law to
bring his great vassal into subjection and establish royalty
in France. He had a ready weapon in the person of young Arthur,
who had already done homage to him for Maine, Anjou, Touraine,
and Brittany. The efforts of the Church were however constantly
exerted to keep the peace between these rivals; and Philip had a
difficulty on his own hands which induced him to desire peace. He
had married Ingelborga of Denmark, but had almost immediately
separated from her and married Agnes de Méranie. The cause of
the divorced princess was warmly taken up at Rome, and in this
year Innocent III. had laid France under an interdict.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Homage of

</div>

<p>Under these circumstances a treaty was patched up. John promised
to young Louis, the heir of France, the hand of
his niece Blanche of Castile, and along with her the
Earldom of Evreux; at the same time pledging himself
not to assist his nephew Otho against the rival Emperor of Germany,
Philip of Swabia. Philip in return secured to England the disputed
province of the Vexin, and for the time dropped the claims of Arthur.
A formal interchange of homage was then made; on the part of
John for his French possessions, on the part of Louis for his newly
acquired earldom, on the part of Arthur for his provinces in France.
John at once began to destroy his good position. A large aid
gathered before his coronation, and another for the purpose of paying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
a sum of money demanded by the late treaty, had already excited
anger in England. He now proceeded to rouse the displeasure of
some of his chief French nobles. He put away his wife Hadwisa,
the daughter of the Earl of Gloucester, and was beginning to treat
for the hand of a Portuguese princess, when he suddenly
fell in love with Isabella, the daughter of the Count of
Angoulême, and carried her off from her betrothed husband,
the Count de la Marche. Before the storm broke, however, he
was able to oblige the Scotch king, with whom he had been in constant
correspondence, to meet him at Lincoln, and there to do him
homage, and to swear to be his liegeman for life, limb
and land. It must be supposed that this was real personal
homage for the kingdom of Scotland, as William the Lion’s claims
on the Northern counties were still postponed.</p>

</div>

<p>But the King’s difficulties soon began. Wishing to collect an
army to suppress disturbances in Poitou, he was met by a refusal
from his barons, who assembled at Leicester, and demanded the
establishment of their rights. The disturbances in Poitou
were caused by the insurrection of the Count de la
Marche, full of anger at losing his wife. Deserted by his barons,
John was unable to suppress the insurrection. He had been invited
to Paris, and received with every demonstration of friendship; but
while there the barons of Poitou, following the policy of Philip
Augustus, and it is fair to believe induced by him, lodged formal
complaints with the French king as their suzerain. John was called
upon to plead before the feudal Court of Peers. He refused, averring
that the Duke of Normandy had never transacted business with his
suzerain except personally upon the borders of his own duchy.
Philip seized the opportunity, urged that the Duke of Normandy was
at the same time Count of Poitou, obtained judgment
against John, declared all his fiefs forfeited and again
raised the claims of Arthur. War was the immediate
consequence. The defection of the Count of Boulogne opened the
west of Normandy, and that side of the country was speedily in the
hands of the French.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of
Arthur.
1203.</div>

<p>Arthur himself now appeared in arms, renounced John, and entered
Poitou in alliance with the insurgent barons. He there besieged
Mirabeau, where the old Queen then was lying ill on her return from
a journey into Spain, whither she had gone to fetch the Princess of
Castile, according to the treaty with the French King. The capture
of the castle seemed inevitable, when John, with one of those sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
acts of vigour which broke his indolent life, suddenly came upon the
besiegers, and surrounded them, rescued his mother, and took the young
prince captive. The war became still more vehement. The Bretons
claimed the restoration of their prince. Philip moved his army to the
Loire, and town after town was captured, while John lay in sensual enjoyment
at Rouen. The Norman barons, unused to an unwarlike governor,
deserted to Philip, and John was compelled to return to England.
He had hardly reached it when the terrible rumour spread
that the young Prince Arthur had disappeared. His fate
is variously related. The more commonly accepted story
is, that, imprisoned at Falaise, under the care of Hubert de Burgh, he
escaped, by the good will of his custodian, from the designs of John,
who had sent to have his eyes put out. He was thence removed to
Rouen, to the charge of Robert de Vipont, and murdered, perhaps by
his uncle’s own hand, and his body thrown into the Seine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Loss of
Normandy.
1205.</div>

<p>However he may have died, his death raised a storm of indignation.
Philip pressed more boldly forward. In March 1204, Chateau Gaillard,
the key of Normandy upon the Seine, was taken. One after the other,
Caen, Bayeux, Coutances, Lisieux, and all the country to Mont
St. Michel, were captured; Rouen alone remained. John was again
summoned before the Peers at Paris. Philip even prepared to invade
England, and to make good there the claims of the Counts of Brabant
and Boulogne, who had married the granddaughters of
King Stephen. In June, Rouen was compelled to capitulate,
and in the following year, Loches and Chinon,
south of the Loire, yielded, and Rochelle, Niort, and Thouars, in
Poitou, were the only towns left in the possession of the English.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Peace with
Philip.
1206.</div>

<p>Meanwhile John had tried in vain to assemble an effective army in
England. He had raised money and collected troops, but it would
seem that they were disaffected; for at the urgent entreaties
of his faithful servants, Hubert of Canterbury
and William Marshall, they were disbanded. One
futile attempt was indeed made from Rochelle, and John boasted
loudly of his capture of Montauban, but he was none the less compelled
in October of this year to make a two years’ peace with Philip.
The connection between England and Normandy was thus for ever
broken; henceforward the country was thrown upon its own resources,
and its life and interests became more distinctly national.</p>

<p>Many causes had been at work to separate the interests of the crown
and nation, but before mentioning them it will be necessary to speak of
the second great event of John’s reign, his dispute with Innocent III.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Election of the
Archbishop of
Canterbury.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Election of
Stephen
Langton.
1207.</div>
</div>

<p>In July 1205, had died Hubert of Canterbury, whose influence as
minister of the crown had been paramount during this
and the preceding reign. The right of election to the
metropolitan See had been constantly disputed between
the monks of the cathedral and the suffragan bishops of the province.
The younger monks thought to steal a march upon their
rivals, and, even before the Archbishop had been buried, had elected
Reginald, the sub-prior. Without waiting for the King’s approval,
which had been invariably required during the reigns of the Norman
kings, they hurried the Archbishop elect abroad, binding him not to
disclose his election till he reached Rome. His vanity got the better
of his wisdom; he boasted of his good fortune. A rumour of what
had been done reached the ears of the King. The elder monks took
fright, betook themselves to John, and received orders from him, in
complete disregard of the claims of the bishops, to elect John de
Grey, Bishop of Norwich, one of his ministers. He was elected, invested
with the temporalities, and messengers stating the fact were at
once sent to Rome. It was now the turn of the bishops to complain.
In point of fact, the last three archbishops had been elected by the
common consent of the bishops and monks, and with the approval of
the crown. The older right was decidedly with the bishops, and
they too despatched messengers to the Papal Court. A claim raised
by three distinct parties, and brought to his court to settle, was
exactly the opportunity Innocent desired. There was much in the
position of England and the English Church which he would have
wished to see changed. The election of bishops and archbishops,
under whatever forms it had been carried on, had been virtually in
the hands of the crown. Many of these appointments had been given
to Churchmen, who had devoted their chief time to the great administrative
system which Henry II. had perfected.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The mixture of lay
and ecclesiastical elements was very objectionable to the Pope; while
if there was one thing more than another which he was desirous of
suppressing, it was the independence of national churches as represented
by their bishops. Innocent, therefore, now ruled that the
bishops had not the slightest voice in the matter, that the monks
alone had from time immemorial possessed the right of election,
although it had accidentally fallen into abeyance. He thus robbed
both king and bishops of their share in the election, and then declaring
that the election of Reginald in the present instance had been
irregular, bade the monks, a considerable number of whom had come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
to Rome, proceed at once to the election of his old friend and fellow-student,
Stephen Langton, cardinal priest of St. Chrysagonus.
He so far acknowledged the existence of John
as to write him several letters pressing him to receive
the Archbishop. On the rejection of these overtures, foreseeing that
he was entering on an important struggle, he arranged a peace with
Philip of Swabia, the rival of Otho the Guelph, the Papal candidate
for the throne of Germany, and proceeded to consecrate the new
archbishop with his own hands at Viterbo.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Excommunication.

</div>

<p>John had already quarrelled with the bishops, because they had
refused, at a council held at St. Albans, to give him a contribution
which he had required, for the assistance of this same Otho, who
was his nephew. The news therefore of the consecration
at Viterbo at once moved him to violence. The monks
of Canterbury were driven from their monastery, and when, in the
following year, an interdict which the Pope had intrusted to the
Bishops of London, Ely and Worcester, was published, his hostility
to the Church became so extreme, that almost all the bishops fled; the
Bishops of Winchester, Durham and Norwich, two of
whom belonged to the ministerial body, being the only prelates
left in England. The interdict was of the severest
form; all services of the Church, with the exception of Baptism and
extreme unction, being forbidden, while the burial of the dead was
allowed only in unconsecrated ground; its effect was however weakened
by the conduct of some of the monastic orders, who claimed exemption
from its operation, and continued their services. The King’s anger
knew no bounds. The clergy were put beyond the protection of the
law; orders were issued to drive them from their benefices, and lawless
acts committed at their expense met with no punishment. While
publishing the interdict, the Pope had threatened still further measures,
and the King, conscious of his unpopularity among the barons,
sought to secure himself from the effects of the threatened excommunication
by seizing their sons as hostages. Nevertheless, though
acting thus violently, John showed the weakness of his character by continued
communication with the Pope, and occasional fitful acts of favour
to the Church; so much so, that, in the following year, Langton prepared
to come over to England, and upon the continued obstinacy of
the King, Innocent, feeling sure of his final victory, did
not shrink from issuing his threatened excommunication.
John had hoped to be able to exclude the knowledge of
this step from the island, as his father Henry had done; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
rumour of it soon got abroad, and its effect was great. The fidelity
even of the ministers was shaken, and one of them rose from the
council table, asserting that it was unsafe for a beneficed clergyman
any longer to hold intercourse with the excommunicated King.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attack on the

<p>In a state of nervous excitement, and mistrusting his nobles, the
King himself perpetually moved to and fro in his kingdom, seldom
staying more than a few days in one place. None the less did he
continue his old line of policy. Sums of money were still frequently
demanded, and sent out of the kingdom to support the cause of Otho,
who, having procured the assassination of his rival, was again
making head in Germany. Nor did he refrain from carrying out a
policy which in any other king would have been accepted as national
and good. The loss of the French provinces had thrown
England back upon itself, and the country now seemed
inclined to seek a surer foundation for its power in the
more complete subjection of the immediately surrounding nations.
Thus William the Lion of Scotland was compelled, by the advance of
an English army, to make a treaty which was in fact a complete submission
to England. He was obliged to pay a large sum of money, and
to give up into the hands of John his daughters Margaret and Isabella,
as well as hostages drawn from the noblest families of the country;
while some years later, in 1212, his son Alexander appeared in London,
and was knighted and swore fealty to the King.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Disaffection of

</div>

<p>Shortly after this success in the North, John betook himself to
Ireland, where quarrels had arisen between the angry
Irish nobles, and where Hugh de Lacy had suppressed
his rival John de Courcy, and, being enfiefed with the kingdom of
Ulster, had arrogated to himself rights closely touching upon royalty.
John raised supplies from the English towns, and crossed over to
Waterford. He there succeeded in establishing order, and having
introduced the English form of administration, returned to England,
leaving John de Grey, Bishop of Norwich, behind him as his
representative. He then directed his arms towards
Wales. Along the marches of that country there was
constant strife, as the Lords Marchers erected new castles and encroached
upon their neighbours. In 1211 the King marched through
the country, and received at the foot of Snowdon the submission of
Llewellyn, his son-in-law,<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and other princes. A fresh outbreak,
accompanied by the usual cruel slaughter of the garrisons of the
castles, roused his anger. At Nottingham he had all the Welsh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
hostages he had taken under the late treaty hanged, and was preparing
for further vengeance when news reached him of the
discontent of the Northern barons. He was induced
therefore to direct his arms against them, filled Northumberland
with his foreign mercenaries, and seized fresh hostages
from his suspected nobles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The King’s
rapacity.</div>

<p>These wars had but afforded still further opportunities for the
King’s rapacity; from which every class in the kingdom
was now suffering. Those classes even which John
had hitherto somewhat spared now felt the pressure. There was a
universal persecution of the Jews, who were all suddenly apprehended,
and many of them tortured to declare their wealth. He is said to
have extracted 60,000 marks from the race. The clergy too had been
obliged to find him £100,000; the Cistercian monks some £30,000, or
£40,000, and subsequently, in 1212, another £12,000 was wrung from
them, because the chief of the order, acting as Papal Legate, had, during
the Albigensian crusade, injured Raymond, the King’s brother-in-law.</p>

<div class="sidenote">League with
Northern
princes.</div>

<p>While he had been thus, even in the pursuit of national objects,
estranging by his tyrannical conduct his own subjects, John had
been carrying on his opposition to the Pope outside the limits of
the kingdom; and events in Europe were rapidly approaching a
crisis. Otho, the Guelphic Emperor, upon the death of his rival,
had so completely succeeded, that in 1209 he had been solemnly
crowned Emperor in Italy. But no sooner had he gained his object
than the inevitable rivalry between Pope and Emperor again arose,
and in a few years he had forfeited the Pontiff’s favour so completely
as to become the object of his greatest hatred; he had even been
excommunicated, while the Pope found a new protegé in the young
Frederick of Sicily, whose anti-papal tendencies were not at that
time suspected. Similarity of circumstances rendered still closer
the bond of union between John and his nephew, and in 1211
a league of excommunicated leaders was formed, including
all the princes of the North of Europe; Ferrand
of Flanders, the Duke of Brabant, John, and Otho, were
all members of it, and it was chiefly organized by the activity of
Reinald of Dammartin, Count of Boulogne. The chief enemy of
most of these confederates was Philip of France; and John thought
he saw in this league the means of revenge against his old enemy.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">John is deposed

<div class="sidenotex">Surrender of

</div>

<p>To complete the line of demarcation between the two parties,
Innocent, who was greatly moved by the description of
the disorders and persecutions in England, declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
John’s crown forfeited, and intrusted the carrying out of the sentence
to Philip. In 1213 armies were collected on both sides, Philip was
already on the Channel, and John had assembled a large army on
Barhamdown, not far from Canterbury. But Innocent probably
never intended to proceed to extremities. To embroil two Christian
nations would have been to thwart one of his greatest objects,
which was a new crusade. But he knew his man; he knew the
weakness which was hidden under the violence and ostentatious
passion of John, and he also well knew from his emissaries in
England the widespread disaffection there. While the army was
still lying in its camp, there appeared at Dover Pandulf,
as the Pope’s Legate. He demanded and obtained an
audience with the King, and there explained to him the
gravity of his position. He found means to bring home to his mind
the perfect insecurity of his position at home, while John, from his
own experience, knew both the power and the skill of Philip. The
consciousness of his danger destroyed his boastful obstinacy, and he
made an unconditional submission. The paper which he signed was
drawn up almost in the very words of the demands of Pandulf. He
offered to plead before the Papal Court; he promised peace and a good
reception to Langton, the other bishops, and banished laity; he was to
restore all Church property, and to make restitution for all loss since the
interdict. Having accepted these conditions, the King went further.
On the 15th of May, at Dover, he formally resigned the crowns of
England and Ireland into the hands of Pandulf, and received them
again as the Pope’s feudatory.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">John’s improved

<div class="sidenotex">Renewed
difficulties
with Stephen
Langton.</div>
</div>

<p>It was not without ulterior objects that John took this disgraceful
step. He believed that he saw in it a way out of all his
difficulties, and the means of revenging himself upon
his enemies. He had no intention of allowing his new position to
interfere with his continental alliances, and it was to their success
that he looked to re-establish his power. When Philip of France
was no longer the agent of Papal authority, he believed that it would
be possible for him to resist the storm that was gathering round
him. He expected that one great victory would go far to give him
back his lost French dominions, when the prestige of success, the
friendship of the Church, and the increase of power derived from
his regained dominions, would make him master of the situation in
England. At first all seemed to work as he wished. Pandulf
immediately hurried to France, and forbade Philip to attack the
Pope’s new vassal. The opportune attacks of Ferrand of Flanders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
diverted the French army towards the dominions of that prince; the
English fleet which was sent to assist the Flemings destroyed the
whole French shipping in the port of Damme; the Archbishop
Langton was received with honour, John threw himself at his feet,
reconciled himself with the Church, issued writs to all the churches
to inquire into the amount of damages to be restored, and ordered a
great council to meet at St. Albans to settle finally the restitution
of the Church property. He then summoned his barons to meet him,
and join him in an attack upon Poitou. But he was mistaken, both
in the character of the Churchman, in whom he hoped to find an
obedient servant of the Papal See, and in the amount of dissatisfaction
among his nobles. The barons of the North refused to follow him,
and the meeting at St. Albans resulted, not in a settlement of
Church difficulties, but in the open declaration of the complaints of
all classes. A few weeks after, Langton, who had seen through the
character of John, and was full of hatred of his tyranny, met an
assembly of malcontents at St. Paul’s in London, and there declaring
that he had found documentary proof of their rights,
produced the coronation charter of Henry I., which
was at once accepted by the barons as the declaration
of the views and demands of their party.</p>

</div>

<p>In the meantime, two events had happened disastrous to the royal
cause. Nicholas of Tusculum had arrived as Papal Legate, and the
justiciary Godfrey Fitz-Peter had died. The Legate, ignorant of the
feelings of the English, and eager to support and make real the Papal
authority, had thoroughly adopted the King’s cause. He threatened
the clergy unless they at once accepted the arrangements which the
King offered; and although it was the very thing which had before
excited the anger of the Pope, he proceeded to fill vacant benefices
with the devoted adherents of the royal party. In the place of the
experienced Fitz-Peter, who, however far he might have strained the
administrative power of the crown, had yet exercised a wholesome
restraint on the King, Peter des Roches was raised to the office of
justiciary, and appointed to be the representative of the crown during
John’s absence in France. The people saw themselves, as they thought,
both in spiritual and temporal matters in the hands of the tyrant.
A great success abroad might yet have checked the
growing disaffection. The King led an army to Rochelle.
At first he was successful everywhere. He overran
Poitou, and crossing the Loire captured Anger, but the
Poitevin barons had been too deeply injured by him to be faithful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
friends; their disaffection soon compelled him to retire. But the
great confederation was at work upon all sides. The Count of
Flanders was pressing in upon the North, Otho was advancing from
Germany. In July a junction was made at Valenciennes. Thither
Philip now betook himself; he was followed faithfully by most of
his great nobles, and by the militia of the chartered cities. The
whole success of his policy was at stake. A defeat would ruin the
object of his life&mdash;the establishment of the royal power in France.
For Otho too the stake was high; the triumph of the Guelphic
house in its long war against the Hohenstaufen would be the fruit of
victory. For such prizes the battle of Bouvines was fought,
at a small place upon the little river Marque. The fortune
of the day was with the French; in all directions they
were victorious. Both for Otho and John the defeat may be said to
have been final; the Emperor withdrew to his hereditary dominions,
in Brunswick, where, after some not very important fighting, he died
in 1218. John returned, having lost his last hope of re-establishing
his power at home by foreign conquests.</p>

1215.</div>

<p>He returned to England to find himself in a worse position than
ever; for Innocent had found out the errors his legate had committed,
and recalled him; and John had lost another of his most
trusty counsellors by the death of the Bishop of Norwich. Thus left
to his own resources, with his usual folly he took the opportunity of
demanding a heavy scutage from those barons who had not followed
him abroad. The nobles of the North rose. A meeting
was held in November at Bury St. Edmunds, and it
was there determined that they would make their formal
demands upon the King in arms at Christmas time. John was
keeping his Christmas at Worcester; but having no doubt heard of
the action of the barons, hurried to London, where they appeared
before him in arms. He demanded till Easter for consideration.
The time was given him. He used it in an attempt to sow dissension
among his enemies. He granted to the Church the free right of
election, hoping thereby to draw Langton from the confederation.
He took the oaths of the crusader to put himself more immediately
under the guardianship of the Church, and hastily summoned troops
of mercenaries from Poitou.</p>

<p>The barons at once reassembled at Brackley. At their head was
Fitz-Walter, an old enemy of the King, and William
Marshall, son of the Earl of Pembroke. Their strength
consisted of the nobles of the North&mdash;and they were spoken of as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Northerners,&mdash;but many barons from other parts of England joined
them, and in spite of various compromises offered by the King, they
laid siege to the castle of Northampton. They there received
messages of adherence from the mayor and citizens of
London, into which city they were received in May;
and thus masters of the greater part of England, and of the capital, they
compelled John to receive them and hear their demands
at Runnymede, a meadow by the Thames’ side not far
from Staines. There was signed, on the 15th of June, the paper of
forty-nine articles, which they presented, and which were afterwards
drawn up into the shape of the sixty-three articles of the Great
Charter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Political
position
of England.</div>

<p>That Great Charter was the joint work of the insurgent lords, and
of those who still in name remained faithful to the
crown. In many points this rising of the barons bears
the appearance of an ordinary feudal insurrection. Closer examination
proves that it was of a different character. The very success of
Henry II in his great plan of national regeneration had tended to
change the character of English politics. Till his time, the bulk of
the people had regarded the crown on the whole as a defence against
their feudal tyrants. In the pursuit of good government he had
crushed the feudal nobles, and had welded Norman and English into
one nation. In so doing, he had greatly increased the royal power;
for in those early times good government invariably implied a strong
monarchy. In patriotic hands his work might have continued. But
when the increased royal power passed to reckless rulers, such as
Richard and John, it enabled them to play the part of veritable
tyrants. They had used this power in ruthlessly pillaging the people.
The great justiciaries, Hubert and Fitz-Peter, content with keeping
order and retaining constitutional forms, had almost of necessity lent
themselves to this course, while lesser officials had undoubtedly
acted with arbitrary violence. The interests of the King and his
ministers had thus become separated from those of the nation. To
oppose this tyranny, nobles and people could now act in concert. The
struggle was no longer between King and people on one side against the
nobles on the other, but nobles and people had joined against the King.
Besides this political change, a great revolution had taken place
in the character of the nobility itself. The feudal nobles, the friends
of the Conqueror, had for the most part given place to a new nobility,
the sons of the counsellors and ministers of Henry II. In the centre
of England alone did remnants of the old feudal families remain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
The insurrection then, coming from the North, was the work not of
feudal barons but of the new ministerial baronage. Again, the claims
raised, although, inasmuch as the monarchy was still in form a feudal
monarchy, they bear a resemblance to feudal claims, were such as
might have been expected from men trained in the habits of administration.
They were claims for the redress of abuses of constitutional
power, and were based upon a written document. In addition to
this, they were supported by the clergy, who were never and could
never be feudal in their views, and by the towns, whose interests
were always opposed to those of the feudal nobility. There is
another thing to be recollected; the Charter, as ultimately granted, was
not the same as the demands of the barons. A considerable number
of the older barons, of the bishops, and even the Archbishop himself,
remained ostensibly true to the King, and were present at Runnymede
as his followers. We are told that it was the younger nobles
who formed the strength of the reforming party. Nevertheless, with
the exception of the King’s actual ministers, and of those foreigners,
the introduction of whom was one of his gravest errors, the whole of
John’s own following acknowledged the justice of the baronial claims,
sympathized with the demands raised, and joined in putting them
into the best shape. The movement was in fact, even where not in
form, national.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magna Charta.</div>

<p>The terms of the Charter were in accordance with this state of
affairs. To the Church were secured its rights and the
freedom of election (1). To the feudal tenants just
arrangements in the matters of wardship, of heirship, widowhood, and
marriage (2-8). Scutage and aids, which John had from the beginning
of his reign taken as a matter of course, were henceforward to be
granted by the great council of the kingdom, except in three cases,
the deliverance of the king from prison, the knighting of his eldest
son, and the marriage of his eldest daughter (12). The same right
was secured by the immediate tenants to their sub-tenants. The
great council was to consist of archbishops, bishops and abbots,
counts and greater barons, summoned severally by writ, and of the
rest of the tenants in chief, summoned by general writ to the sheriff
(14). The lands of sub-tenants, seized by the king for treason or
felony, were to be held by him for a year only, and then to be handed
over to the tenant’s immediate lord (32). Similarly the crown was
no longer to claim wardship in the case of sub-tenants, nor to change
the custom of escheated baronies, nor to fill up vacancies in private
abbeys (43, 46). These are all distinct regulations of feudal relations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
The more general acts of tyranny of the crown were guarded
against, by fixing the Court of Common Pleas at Westminster (17);
by the settlement of land processes by itinerant justices in the counties
where the disputes arose (18); by the limitations of punishments within
reasonable limits (20-22); by the restriction of the powers of constables,
sheriffs, and other royal officers, both in the matter of royal lawsuits
and of purveyance (28-31); by an article (36), which is held to
foreshadow the Habeas Corpus Act, stipulating the immediate
trial of prisoners; and by other articles (38-40), which are held to
foreshadow trial by jury, and which forbid the passing of sentence
except on the verdict of a man’s equals, and witness upon oath.
Other points secured their liberties to the free towns and to
merchants. This Charter was to be guaranteed by the appointment
of a committee of twenty-five nobles, any four of whom might claim
redress for infractions of it, and upon refusal proceed to make war
upon the king.</p>

</div>

<p>This Charter, which with its final clause implied absolute submission,
John never intended to keep. No sooner were
his first ebullitions of anger over, than he proceeded to
take steps for destroying it. Messengers were at once
sent to Rome to get it annulled, and to Poitou to collect mercenaries.
Troops came over in crowds, and the barons in alarm ordered
William D’Aubigné to attack the castle of Rochester. He seized it,
but was there besieged, and compelled to surrender to John’s mercenaries.
All the common men of the garrison were hanged. John’s
other message was equally successful. A letter from Innocent
announced that he totally disallowed the Charter, and ordered Langton
to excommunicate the King’s enemies. This he refused to do,
and other excommunications and interdicts were also futile. John’s
temporal weapons were more successful. He overran England with
his mercenaries, burning, slaying and harrying with
vindictive fury, and so superior was he in the field, that
the barons found themselves obliged to summon Louis
of France to their assistance. Louis’ wife was John’s niece, and they
probably intended to use this slender connection to change the
dynasty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John’s death.</div>

<p>His success was not very rapid, though at first he seemed to have the
game in his hands. He wasted his time and lost his opportunity before
the castles of Dover and Windsor. His conduct also in bestowing fiefs
upon his French followers began to excite the jealousy of the English;
and John’s cause was again wearing a more hopeful appearance, when,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
marching from Lincoln, which he had lately conquered, he crossed
the Wash, with all his supplies which he had lately drawn from
Lynn. The rise of the tide destroyed the whole of his train, and
broken by his loss, or perhaps poisoned, or perhaps a
victim to his greediness, he died on the 19th of October
at Newark. In July of the same year he had lost his great protector
Innocent III.</p>

Henry’s accession.<br /><br />

measures.<br /><br />

Louis leaves
England.</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Immediately upon the death of John, William Marshall, Earl
of Pembroke, and Gualo, the Papal Legate, the leaders of John’s
faithful followers, declared Prince Henry king. It was
a moment of extreme danger. The Scotch had advanced
as far as Carlisle, the Welsh were harassing the Marches,
the East and South of England were in the hands of Louis and the
revolted barons, the court could with difficulty uphold its influence
in the West. But Marshall was a man of tried experience, of trustworthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
character, and, though a firm adherent of the crown, no friend
to tyranny. The presence of the French prince in England shocked
all national prejudices. Pembroke set on foot a policy
of conciliation, and attempted to unite all parties against
the foreigner. He at once separated the cause of the
young Henry from that of his father by accepting the Charter. He
wrote friendly letters to the leaders of the revolted barons, and found
assistance in the ecclesiastical weapons wielded by Gualo. One by
one the insurgents, feeling themselves sure of constitutional treatment
at the hands of Pembroke, joined the royal party. Pembroke found
himself strong enough to risk a battle. Louis had received reinforcements,
and with the insurgent nobles who still upheld his cause
marched to Lincoln, where, though the town was in his possession,
the castle still held out for the English king. Thither
Pembroke betook himself, determined to bring on a
decisive engagement. Gaining access to the town through the castle,
his troops fell upon the French in the streets, and completely routed
them, capturing nearly all the English leaders. London and its
neighbourhood alone remained to Louis, and when a great French
fleet, under Eustace the Monk, which was bringing him assistance, was
completely defeated by Hubert de Burgh and D’Albiney, Louis felt
that his cause was lost, and consented to treat. The
English, who only wanted to get rid of him, granted
easy terms, including the freedom of most of their prisoners. They
even advanced 10,000 marks towards defraying the heavy fine which
Gualo on the part of the Church demanded as an expiation for
disobedience to the Roman See, and Louis was escorted with all
honour to the sea coast, and retired.</p>



<p>With Louis the great obstacle to the settlement of the country was
gone. Pembroke continued to act in a conciliatory spirit. A pardon
was issued, including all political offenders; peace with Scotland
was secured; and the Charter, together with the charter of the forests,
was again signed. It underwent, however, some changes. The King
was no longer acting under coercion; restrictions which Pembroke
considered inexpedient were therefore removed. His object appears
to have been to reproduce as far as possible the state of things existing
in the reign of Henry II. The destruction of castles erected during
the late reign was therefore ordered, and the clause of the Charter
forbidding the levy of scutage without the consent of the barons
omitted. The reconciliation thus effected was in fact the triumph of
the crown; the offices were filled with adherents of John. But in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the hands of Pembroke the regained power of the crown would have
been constitutionally employed.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">His fall.</div>
</div>

<p>His death opened the door to a strange attempt on the part of the
Papal See. The influence of Gualo, the Papal Legate,
had been great. It had been so because John’s resignation
of his crown was regarded at Rome as no vain formality,
but as a real cession. But Gualo, a man of somewhat weak
character, was no match for Pembroke, and was unfitted to make good
the authority which Rome was inclined to claim. He was recalled,
and a much more energetic legate appointed in the person of Pandulf,
now Bishop elect of Norwich. His appointment represents
an effort on the part of Rome to govern England as a conquered province
by means of its legates. The natural governor of England during
the minority of the sovereign was the great justiciary Hubert de Burgh.
But Pandulf assumed authority over him, and his letters amply
prove how overbearingly he used it. His government was
at first successful. The dangers of a French invasion were
averted by a renewal for four years of the Peace of Chinon. The
friendship of Scotland was secured by the marriage of Henry’s sister
Jane with the Scotch king. A splendid coronation, and an ostentatious
ceremonial at the removal of Becket’s bones to the Cathedral of
Canterbury, seemed to show the restored grandeur both of King and
Church; while a Bull from Pope Honorius commanded the restoration
of the royal castles, which the poverty of the King had, in many
instances, obliged him to pledge to their governors. But Pandulf’s
conduct was too overbearing to be endured. Langton, as the head
of the English Church, and therefore no friend to the immediate
government of Rome, tried to curb him by demanding
his obedience as one of his suffragan bishops. The Pope
declared him free from this obedience so long as his consecration to
the See of Norwich was uncompleted. Langton finally betook himself
to Rome, and there, by what means we know not, succeeded in obtaining
an order for his recall, accompanied by a promise that no resident
legate should be appointed in England during his own lifetime.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Triumph of
national part
under Herbert
de Burgh.</div>

<p>Hubert de Burgh at once took his proper position as regent,
supported by the national Church; and the attempt at
immediate rule from Rome may be said to have failed,
though throughout the reign England was regarded as in
a special manner a fief of the Papal See, and, as Pope Innocent IV.
said afterwards, “a well of wealth from which Rome might draw unlimitedly.”
For eight years Hubert ruled England well. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
unduly grasping of money, he was occasionally arbitrary, but on
the whole his government was directed to the honest support of the
Great Charter, and the destruction of that foreign influence under
which England was suffering.</p>

</div>

<p>The centre of this influence was Peter des Roches, who had the care
of the King’s person. These two ministers, Hubert and
Peter, were the representatives of the different sides of that
quarrel which gives its tone to the whole reign. The characteristic feature
of the period is the growth of national feeling. This feeling had
been outraged by John by the introduction of foreign favourites. The
claims of the Pope on England, the tyranny which he exercised on the
national Church, and the constant bestowal of English livings upon
foreigners, had a similar effect in shocking the feelings of the clergy.
Thus while the Pope and King appear throughout the reign as the
favourers of foreigners, the national party both in State and Church were
closely connected. As yet, indeed, the King was too young for such a
part; the representative of the foreign party was Des Roches. Round
him gathered themselves all classes of malcontents, consisting chiefly
of those foreign mercenaries whom John had raised to power, and who
were occupying the royal castles, of Llewellyn of Wales in close connection
with them, and of the nobles of Ireland. Des Roches’ influence
at Rome secured for this party on most points the support of
the Pope. For two years they were constantly thwarting the government
of De Burgh. The necessities of the government had obliged
him to be severe in the collection of money; but there was some
slight colouring for the charge of undue severity which was laid
against him. An uproar in London, headed by Constantine Fitz-Alulf,
an old partisan of the French invaders, had been followed by
the summary execution of that demagogue. Attacks both in Wales
and in Ireland upon the property of William Marshall, who was
thoroughly English in his views, were the first signs of the coming
storm. A Bull which De Burgh obtained from Honorius declaring
the King of age, and demanding the restitution of the castles,
brought matters to a crisis. Under this provocation the barons and
Peter des Roches proceeded to action. An attack on London was
planned, but failed. But the discontented nobles openly
appeared before the King; and Peter des Roches formally
charged Hubert with treason, and demanded his
dismissal. Led by the Earl of Chester, they retired, and kept Christmas
with great pomp at Leicester. The Justiciary and the King
determined to hold a rival meeting at Northampton. The royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
appeal for help was warmly answered. The force collected at Northampton
was too strong for the malcontents. Excommunication
issued against them by Stephen Langton
completed their discomfiture. They separated and obtained peace
as a price of the surrender of the castles. There was one exception,
Faukes de Breauté, who contrived to retain his strongholds. This
man, a mercenary of John, had risen to be the sheriff of six counties,
the governor of several castles, and a Baron of the Exchequer.
Hubert determined to complete his victory by
destroying him. His opportunity occurred, when Faukes’
brother William laid hands on the travelling justice Henry Braibroc
and imprisoned him at Bedford. With extreme rapidity De Burgh
marched against him and captured Bedford. Faukes fled to join his
former comrades; but it was in vain that both Chester and Peter des
Roches, now at one with the Justiciary, petitioned in his favour,
De Burgh remained unmoved, and De Breauté was stripped of all
his offices, and condemned to perpetual exile. He betook himself
to Rome, where he managed to obtain the ear of the Court, and
still further increased the difficulties of the English government.</p>

</div>

<p>Although he had thus worsted his domestic enemies the Justiciary
was surrounded with difficulties. Philip Augustus had
died in 1223, and had been succeeded by his son Louis
VIII., the old enemy of England. He had begun his
reign with a threat of renewed war, to which the disturbed state of
Poitou and Guienne afforded a constant opportunity. In those
countries there was a succession of unceasing disputes between town
and town and noble and noble; the country roughly forming itself
into two parties, the towns and the nobles. In 1224, war had in fact
broken out. Henry had sought the friendship of the German
Emperor Frederick against France, and connected himself with Peter
Duke of Brittany, and when Louis appeared at the head of a great
army, nominally for a war against the Albigenses, it seemed probable
that its real aim was the English provinces. Louis’ unexpected
death changed the state of affairs. The new king was a child in the
hands of his mother Blanche, and the French nobles took
the opportunity to loosen the connection between themselves
and the crown which Philip II. had established, and thus
destroyed for the present the possibility of united national action.
But although, on the first slackening of authority, all Poitou passed
into the English hands, the chance of forming a united opposition
among the discontented French nobles was allowed to pass unused.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
One by one even the old allies of the English returned to their
allegiance to France. At length, Richard, the King’s
brother, who had the title of Count of Poitou, and
had commanded his army, joined in the general pacification.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hubert’s
continued power.</div>

<p>It was the financial difficulties of the government which had chiefly
prevented the success of this war. The opposition to Hubert de
Burgh was constant, and it had only been upon condition of again
signing the Charter that the King had been able to raise
a fifteenth for the French war. This tax was probably
the first raised in strict accordance with the terms of the Charter. De
Burgh was honestly desirous, in opposition to the arbitrary views of
his rival Des Roches, that the King should rule constitutionally, and
both by proclamation and by official letters he took care to spread a
knowledge of the Charter in the country. Although Henry was
declared of age in 1227, when he was twenty, the government of De
Burgh practically continued. He was made Earl of Kent, and
declared Justiciary for life; and his victory was completed by the
absence of Peter des Roches, who thought it better to withdraw for a
time to the Crusades. His rule was not very popular among the
nobles: not only was he naturally disliked by the chiefs of the
adverse party, he even quarrelled with Richard, the King’s brother,
and with William Marshall. Such an act indeed as the following
could scarcely have failed to make him enemies. An inquisition was
issued to examine into the title deeds<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> of all tenants in chief, who
were obliged to make good their titles by large payments. The sum
derived from this inquiry amounted to £100,000.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Langton supports
his policy.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Change of
Popes: increased
exactions.</div>
</div>

<p>The support which the Justiciary invariably received from Langton
bears witness to the national character of his government.
The Archbishop’s efforts to free the Church from
its foreign slavery were perhaps even more laborious than those of
the Justiciary. Already the system which reached such excesses
afterwards had been established. Gualo and Pandulf had been but
single instances of a number of Roman officials who had grown rich
on gifts of English benefices; and now the Roman Court determined,
under the pretext of raising money for the Crusade, to demand both
in France and England two benefices in each diocese and each abbey
for the exclusive use of Rome. In neither country was the demand
allowed. Otho, a Papal legate, held a council in 1226 at Westminster,
and brought forward the demand. The clergy would probably
have had to yield, had not the Archbishop, by private negotiations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
with the Pope, succeeded in getting the Legate’s commission
withdrawn. The clergy then expressly declared that by the laws of
England they were free from such exactions. That England was
allowed thus to escape, and that the exactions were comparatively so
light in these first years of the reign, is due to the character of
Honorius and to the interest which he always took in the young
King, whom he regarded as his special vassal and ward. The case
was different when he was succeeded by Gregory IX.,
the nephew of Innocent III., and the heir to his imperious
temper. It was fortunate that his constant war
with the German Emperor prevented him from meddling much
with English politics.</p>

<p>But this period, during which England was governed by such

one another, was coming to a close. In 1228, the Archbishop
died, and was succeeded, after a disputed election,
by Richard Chancellor of Lincoln, who was authoritatively
nominated by the Pope. The new Archbishop did not live long,
and was in his turn succeeded, also on the nomination of the Pope, by
Edmund Rich, a man of great sanctity and singleness of purpose. In
the following year, a quarrel occurred between the King and the
Justiciary, which was probably the beginning of that nobleman’s fall.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Quarrel of

<div class="sidenotex">Henry’s false
foreign policy.</div>
</div>

<p>Henry, now that he was of age, had become anxious to distinguish
himself by regaining some of his continental dominions.
To this he was pressed by the discontented French
nobles, more especially by the Count of Toulouse,
who was suffering from the Albigensian crusades, by the Counts
of Brittany and of the provinces in the north-east of France.
In other words, he was thinking of throwing England back
into that position of entanglement and dependence
which had hitherto prevented the formation of the
national spirit. This was exactly opposed to the Justiciary’s views.
He was unable to change the King’s mind; but when Henry
arrived at Portsmouth, where his army was assembled, he found the
ships insufficient for its transport. Full of rage, he turned upon
Hubert, abusing him as a grey-haired traitor, and affirming that he
was bribed by France. The expedition had to be postponed, which
was fortunate, as the scutage which had been demanded from the
Barons and the Church had indeed been granted, but not yet collected.
It was not till the end of April 1230 that the armies sailed. Although
the expedition was unwise in itself, it was well timed. With the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
exception of the Count of Champagne, nearly all the French Barons
were in arms, or ready to rise, against the Queen Regent Blanche;
but Henry was incapable of seizing the opportunity. He tried diplomacy
instead of war, but it was in vain that he persuaded many of
the Barons of Poitou to join him; Blanche found means to break up
the confederation against her. This change in the aspect of affairs
compelled Henry to make a truce, and before the end of the year
he returned home, leaving a small army behind him.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Twenge’s riots.</div>
</div>

<p>Under pretext of continuing the war, a new scutage was demanded
and granted, not without opposition from the clergy; but finally a
peace for three years was concluded in July 1231, which was again
renewed for five years in 1235. We may suppose, although Henry
declared that he was on perfectly good terms with the Justiciary, that
their great difference on foreign policy made his suspicious mind
inclined to listen willingly to the insinuations of Des
Roches, his evil genius, who in this year returned from
the Crusade. Every difficulty of the Justiciary was artfully taken
advantage of. Among other things laid to his charge was the insecure
state of the Welsh borders. He was even represented as fostering a
strange lawless opposition to the encroachment of Rome, which had
been showing itself in the kingdom. A secret society, part lay, part
clerical, had been formed to check the habit of granting English
livings to foreign priests, thus not only destroying the funds of the
English clergy, but overriding the rights of private patronage. The
society wrote letters to all ecclesiastical bodies, threatening them
with vengeance if they paid the incomes of the foreign interlopers.
The associates did not confine themselves to threats;
several foreign priests were robbed and outraged. The
head of the conspiracy, Sir Robert Twenge, boldly justified his
conduct to the King, and was allowed to depart unharmed, and carry
his complaints direct to Rome. The rioters were said to have shown
in their justification letters from the Justiciary.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Fall of
De Burgh.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Effects of
taking sanctuary.</div>
</div>

<p>It is scarcely possible that this could have been true; but, together
with the disturbances on the Welsh Marches, it formed
the chief among a series of very trivial charges which
were brought against Hubert, and produced his fall. On the 29th of
July 1232, he was suddenly suspended from all his offices. His place
was taken by Stephen de Segrave, a close ally of Des Roches. Peter
de Rivaux, probably the Bishop’s son, was made treasurer, and other
favourites of the Bishop were raised to office. Hubert, aware of the
strength of his enemies, took refuge in the Priory of Merton in Surrey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
He was granted a few weeks to prepare his defence, and to get ready
accounts which were demanded of all the money that had ever passed
through his hands. Supposing that he was thus at liberty for the
present, he went to Bury St. Edmunds to join his wife, but on his
journey thither, at Brentwood, he was, by order of the Court, assaulted,
and fled for refuge to the sanctuary of a neighbouring chapel. He
was torn from his refuge, and hurried to London. The favour he
had gained in the eyes of the people and his whole political aim are
well shown in the words that are reported to have been used by a
smith when ordered to put irons on him: “Is not this that true and
noble Hubert who has so often snatched England from the devastating
hand of the foreigners, and made England, England?” The
Church obliged Henry to restore him to his sanctuary, and the love
with which he was regarded was shown by the touching offer of his
own chaplain, Luke, Bishop of Dublin, to give himself up in his
place. The effect of taking sanctuary was, that the
fugitive was bound to swear before the coroner that he
would leave England for ever. This exile he was bound to seek
within forty days, leaving the coast within a tide after his arrival
there, or, if the wind made that impossible, walking daily into the
sea to show his willingness to do so. Hubert could not bring himself
to abjure England; he would not therefore leave his sanctuary, and
being surrounded by his enemies, was starved into submission. He
was treated mercifully; his Crown fiefs were taken from him, his
own property he retained, but he was kept in confinement in the
Castle of Devizes.</p>

</div>

<p>Once in command of the government, Peter des Roches pushed
headlong to the attainment of his objects. The friends of
De Burgh were swept from the Court. The offices were
filled with foreigners. Henry was persuaded to bring over
2000 troops from France. But Hubert was not the only Englishman
among the nobility. Richard Marshall of Pembroke, the second son
of the great Regent, and now his representative, raised the voice of
patriotism, and declared to the King that as long as foreigners were
ruling none of his English counsellors would appear at Court. Des
Roches answered insolently that the King and his foreigners would
soon bring rebels to reason. At assemblies at Oxford
and at Westminster the same sort of language was used.
By Peter’s advice, the King began to proceed against his
discontented subjects. He deprived Gilbert Basset of his property,
and ordered the apprehension of his brother-in-law Siward; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
fled to the Earl Marshall, their property fell to Rivaux. In August,
a day was appointed for the delivery of hostages by the suspected
nobles. Pembroke, the Marshall, hearing that there was a plot
against his life, retired to his Welsh possessions. The King summoned
troops to meet him at Gloucester. The Marshall and his friends were
outlawed without trial; fresh foreign troops came thronging over,
and civil war began. The King’s army did not fare well, and the
clergy began to take up the cause of the Marshall. They protested
against the confiscation of a peer’s property without trial. “There
are no peers in England,” said Des Roches, “as in France; the King
may sentence whom he will, and drive them from the country.” The
clergy could not hear such absolute principles unmoved. They
threatened Des Roches and his favourites with excommunication;
and when the King demanded their censure upon the Marshall for
an attack upon Gloucester, they said the city was his, and they found
no grounds for censure.</p>

</div>

<p>Meanwhile, afraid for his life, De Burgh had escaped from Devizes
and again taken sanctuary. Again he was illegally torn from it,
again the Church remonstrated, and he was again restored. A sudden
inroad into Wiltshire under the Marshall’s friend Siward set him at
liberty, and he immediately joined the Marshall at Strigul. Again
and again the royal troops were worsted; and at length,
in 1234, at a meeting of the clergy at Westminster, Archbishop
Edmund took the matter up, explained to the
King the wretched effects of trusting to his foreign
counsellors, warned him that excommunication would most likely
fall upon him too, and induced him at length to order the Bishop of
Winchester to retire and attend to his spiritual work in his diocese.
For a month longer the war went on, or rather attacks continued to
be made upon the followers of Peter. But in May, news arrived that
Richard Marshall had been treacherously killed in Ireland at the
instigation of Des Roches. This was more than the King himself
could bear, and the Archbishop received orders to restore to favour
all those whom Des Roches had outlawed. Gilbert Marshall received
the property and office of his late brother, and Hubert was allowed
to retain the earldom of Kent and his own property. This change
was followed by the removal of Peter’s creatures. After some years
of absence, he himself returned to England, was received into favour,
and died in his diocese in 1239.</p>

<p>The fall of Des Roches was not productive of such advantageous
changes in the government as might have been expected. Segrave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
held for a few years the office of Justiciary. On his death the office
was not renewed till after the Parliament at Oxford. Ralph Neville
continued in more or less favour as Chancellor till 1244,
when that office also fell into abeyance. The King
practically became his own minister, and unfortunately
his views of government had more in common with those of Des
Roches than with those of De Burgh. It is true that the growing
power of the Great Council, which was gradually gaining the name of
Parliament, prevented any great infractions of the Charter, and compelled
the King again and again to renew that document, though
always in exchange for an aid. The frequency of renewal, however,
seems to show repeated efforts on the part of the King to free himself
from it; nor was the state of his treasury such as to enable him to do
without legitimate sources of revenue. The real faults of his reign
were not illegal extensions of the royal power, but the readiness with
which he allowed and even joined in the exactions of the Papal See,
and the total absence of national objects which distinguish his rule,
which may be traced to his culpable partiality to foreigners. From
the year 1236 till the Parliament of Oxford, these errors were continually
on the increase.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Henry’s
marriage.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Influence of the
Queen’s uncles.</div>
</div>

<p>The first great influx of foreigners was caused by his marriage. In
1236, he married Eleanor, the second daughter of Count
Raymond Berenger of Provence, and sister of the Queen
of France. From that moment, the Court was in the hands of the
Queen’s relatives. It was especially the Queen’s uncles
into whose hands patronage fell. William, Bishop of
Valence, was the first. To him was given the vast property of
Richmond in Yorkshire, which had previously belonged to the Counts
of Brittany, and the King had almost succeeded in securing for him
the Bishopric of Winchester when news of his death was brought.
He was succeeded by another uncle, Peter of Savoy. Richmond was
handed on to him; Pevensey and Hastings were intrusted to him,
and the wardship of the Earl of Warrenne, which completed his
power in the south-east corner of England. To increase his influence,
he brought over numbers of young foreign ladies, and married them
to some of the great Earls of England. The death of Edmund Rich,
Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1240, allowed the King to secure that
See, after an interval of five years, for another of his uncles, Boniface,
whose violence and warlike bearing, as well as his youth, made him
a strange contrast to his predecessor. Peter de Aigue Blanche,
another Savoyard, was made Bishop of Hereford, and afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
became Henry’s disreputable agent in the business of the Sicilian
monarchy. This lavish support of foreigners naturally caused great
discontent in England, and was repeatedly the subject of complaints
in the Great Council. Thus, in 1236 and 1237, there were three
stormy councils, nor was the money the King required granted till
the sanctions of the Magna Charta were again renewed. The arrival
of the Cardinal Otho as Papal Legate did not mend matters; his
efforts at reconciliation were useless, and he soon tuned his attention
to collecting money for the Church. At this time, for a very short
period, it seemed as if Richard Earl of Cornwall, the King’s brother,
might have assumed the post of leader of the English party; but his
patriotic efforts were short-lived. A few years after he married the
Queen’s sister, and threw his influence upon the side of the foreigners.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Formation of a
national party
under Simon
de Montfort.</div>

<p>A far greater man took the post he thus resigned. Simon de
Montfort, destined to be the real national leader of
England, was rising into importance. The sister and
heiress of Count Robert of Leicester had married the
Count of Montfort, and died in 1204. In 1215, the whole English
property had been given to Ralph Earl of Chester. Simon de
Montfort, the Conqueror of the Albigenses, never possessed it,
but his eldest son Almaric, after the death of the Earl of Chester,
in 1232, demanded the property and honours of Leicester for
his younger brother Simon, who was thus acknowledged as the
owner of the property. He held the bason of water as High-Steward
at the Queen’s coronation, shortly after married the King’s sister, the
widow of William, second Earl of Pembroke, and succeeded in getting
that marriage acknowledged by Gregory IX. in 1238. Like all those
who had to do with Henry, he was obliged to bear extraordinary
changes of fortune from the fickle character of the King. An angry
quarrel drove him abroad, and, in 1240, in company with Richard of
Cornwall, he set out for the Holy Land.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Revival in the
Church.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Grostête.</div>
</div>

<p>During their absence the government of England grew continually
worse. Men began to weary of the personal government of the King.
For several years the great offices of justiciary and chancellor had been
left unfilled, and their duties performed by subordinate officials, upon
whom the King lavished his favours. One of the chief of these was
Mansell, who is said to have held no less than 700 livings, and to
have been in the yearly receipt of 8000 marks. The Church was
gradually driven to make common cause with the lay
opposition. It was a time of spiritual revival. The
great monastic orders had lapsed into the position of wealthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
landowners. The work which in the early times they had so well
performed, the civilization of the country districts, was over. They
had become lazy and luxurious. The prelates had for the most part
deserted their spiritual calling and become statesmen. The Church
as a whole, as represented by the Pope, had misused its influence.
Crusades had become the instruments of temporal aggrandizement,
or of revenge upon the personal enemies of the Pope. A spiritual
revival had been set on foot almost at the same time by St. Dominic
and St. Francis d’Assisi, who had founded the two great orders of
Dominicans and Franciscans, the Black and Grey Friars. The vow
of poverty, evaded by the older orders, had become a reality. The
establishments of the Friars had met with great success; thousands
thronged to be enrolled in their orders. They had rapidly spread
over Europe, and had lately arrived in England, and there begun
their work of regeneration. They had laboured chiefly in the
towns and among the most wretched outcasts of society, and had
there called into life new religious energy, mingled with hatred
towards their wealthy predecessors the old monks, and with a consciousness
of personal equality in the sight of God, which tended
much to strengthen the democratic feeling which supplied Simon de
Montfort with his strongest support. Their teaching had not
affected the lower classes alone; numbering among them many
learned men, they speedily got possession of the education at Oxford,
and found a friend in Grostête, the learned Bishop of
Lincoln. The reforms which the Church demanded
were carried out by him as far as possible in his diocese; and under
his guidance, and that of Edmund Rich, the Church of England was
becoming at once spiritual and national. The folly of the King, who
filled the high ecclesiastical offices with foreign favourites, the
exactions of the Pope, who, acting hand in hand with him, placed
hundreds of benefices in the hands of Italian priests, compelled all
that was best in the Church to throw itself absolutely on the side of
the reformers.</p>

</div>

<p>Ecclesiastical and secular misgovernment went on side by side.
Disastrous expeditions to France, and consequent exactions from the
people, were intermingled with the visits of Papal emissaries, to wring
from the wretched clergy contributions for the Papal war against
the Hohenstaufen. In 1242, the King undertook to regain
Poitou. Richard of Cornwall had been nominal
Count of that province, when, in 1241, Louis gave his brother
Alphonse the same title. The most important nobleman in the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
was the Count de la Marche, who had married Henry’s mother. He
at first did homage to the new Count, but afterwards, urged it is
supposed by his ambitious wife, renounced his fealty, and demanded
assistance from Henry. The King therefore landed in the following
year in Gascony. De la Marche soon began to repent of what he had
done, and Henry, never a very active warrior, was disheartened by
his treachery. The armies at length met near Taillebourg, on the
Charente. Afraid of being surrounded, Henry employed his brother
Richard, who had gained general favour with the French by liberally
ransoming prisoners in the Crusade, to secure an armistice. He took
the opportunity of falling back to Saintes, where he was almost
surprised by the pursuing enemy. After this he was gradually
driven backwards to the Garonne, while Marche and his revolted
barons again accepted their French lord. The year was wasted in
fruitless negotiations with the discontented Count of Toulouse, and
in collecting money and troops from England. Henry quarrelled
with his own nobles, who gradually left his army; and early in 1243
returned to England, having accepted a peace, which
deprived him of the whole of Poitou and of the Isle of
Rhé. Gascony was now the only part of France remaining to the
English. It was during this campaign that Richard of
Cornwall met and married Sancha, the Queen’s sister,
throwing up from this time all chance of leading the
national party, and attaching himself to the foreigners.</p>

</div>

<p>Such a war did not tend to the popularity of the King. The
exchequer had been empty, money was stringently and
often illegally exacted. A new Pope, Innocent IV.,
was elected, and the exactions from the English clergy
resumed more vigorously than ever: for the Pope was carrying on
the contest he had inherited against Frederick II., and was now
summoning at Lyons the council his predecessor had
failed to collect, in hopes of destroying for ever the
power of the Hohenstaufen. His agent, Master Martin, travelled
through England, pillaging the clergy till the English could bear it
no longer, and the barons joined with the Church in demanding his
dismissal. The foreign element in the Church too continued its
baneful activity. Boniface, the Archbishop, laid waste his rich see,
cutting down the timber and sending the profits abroad, while the
King attempted, though in vain, to secure the Bishopric of
Chichester for Robert de Passelewe. The nation determined to
demand its rights at the Council of Lyons. The English ambassadors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
there took an opportunity of charging the Pope with not being contented
with his Peter’s Pence and the yearly 1000 marks
which John had promised, with sending his messengers
to make further exactions, and with filling English benefices
against the will of their patrons with Italian priests. 60,000
marks a year thus passed into the hands of foreigners, ignorant of the
language, and mostly living abroad. The Pope vouchsafed no answer,
but shortly afterwards issued a Bull forbidding pluralities, and promising
to respect the rights of patrons. The Bull remained a dead
letter; and the very next year 6000 marks were exacted, and foreign
priests were as plentiful as ever, admitted to their benefices under
what was spoken of as “non obstante” clauses, which set aside all
previous Bulls. The feeling in England against the Pope, who
exacted, and the King, who allowed the exactions, grew more and
more determined.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1247 matters grew still worse. A fresh swarm of foreigners
arrived in England; De la Marche was dead, and the
King’s half-brothers came over and were at once received
with favour and honoured with profuse gifts. Chief
among them was William of Valence, and his brother Aymer, who,
in the year 1250, was made Bishop of Winchester, though he was
never consecrated. The foreign policy of England was by these men
managed for their own interests. Thus on the death of Raymond
Berenger, Provence was allowed to pass into the hands of Charles of
Anjou, who had married the Queen’s youngest sister; and thus Henry
made use of a crusade, on which he said that he was going, to demand
large sums of money from the people. In 1248 the crisis seemed
approaching. At a meeting of Parliament many charges were raised
against the favourites; and the feeling against the King’s
personal government, which had long been growing,
found vent. In blind security, Henry continued his course. The
King’s revenue, squandered in empty magnificence or
lavish grants to his foreign friends, became more and
more dilapidated. Money had to be borrowed. All men with an income
of £20 were compelled to take up their knighthood; and afraid
to have recourse to illegal aids from the nobility, the King turned
upon the cities, more especially London, and demanded
and obtained great tallages from them. The crusade
constantly supplied him with an excuse for these exactions; yet even
when the King of France was taken prisoner in Egypt, Henry and his
crusaders made no movement. He contented himself with appointing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
a day for his expedition; the expedition itself did not take place.
Innocent indeed had other ends in view; he was bent
far more on the destruction of the Hohenstaufen than on
the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre. Frederick II. had
died in December 1250, and the Pope’s energies were now directed
to driving those who remained of this family from their kingdom of
the two Sicilies.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Montfort’s

of Gascony.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">His quarrel
with the King.</div>
</div>

<p>Far indeed from assisting Louis, Henry had regarded his absence
as an opportunity for regaining his power in the south of France.
Gascony was in a state of complete confusion, chiefly through the
insurrections of Gaston of Bearn and assaults from the King of
Navarre. To bring it into order, Henry had, in 1248, appointed
Simon de Montfort his governor there. His government
had been completely successful, and at length, in
1250, Gaston was sent a prisoner to England. In his
foolish soft-heartedness, Henry at once pardoned and released him.
But the vigorous government of Simon had excited the displeasure
both of the nobles and of the towns. They sent an embassy under
the Archbishop of Bordeaux to lay charges against him before Henry.
The King, fickle and jealous, listened to them; and Leicester was
summoned home. He had almost ruined himself in his efforts to
carry on his government well, and an angry scene of
personal recrimination occurred, the King charging him
with treason, while Simon demanded repayment for the money he
had expended. It shows the state of personal contempt into which
the King had fallen, that Leicester could venture to give him the lie
direct. But the King could not do without him; by the influence
of the Earl of Cornwall the quarrel was adjusted, and De Montfort
returned as he believed to his government. His back was scarcely
turned when the King appointed in his place his young son Edward,
and ordered the Gascons not to obey De Montfort. Feeling himself
thus freed from his charge, De Montfort went to Paris. The
opinion of his abilities was so high, that he was offered the regency
of France; but slighted though he had been at home, he was still
true to his adopted country, and declined the flattering offer.</p>

</div>

<p>Left to himself, Henry found the Gascons more than he could
manage. He collected indeed much money for the expedition; the
Charter being renewed as usual as the price of a grant. The
Jews had to advance money, the towns were tallaged.
But, after all, things would have gone badly had not
Leicester again patriotically offered his services, and taken command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
of the disturbed province. With his assistance, and with money
obtained from England, by dint of lying letters, narrating the extreme
danger of the King from the approach of a vast army of Christians
and Saracens under the King of Castile, peace was made with
Alphonso X., at that time the King of Castile, and a marriage arranged
between Edward and his daughter the Princess Eleanor. This expedition
therefore had on the whole been successful; but it plunged the
King still deeper into money difficulties, while his constant
demands for money, and the dishonest means he
had taken to secure it, had lowered him still further in the eyes of
the people. His foolish ambition and his adherence to the Papal
See completed what his long reign of misgovernment had begun.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">The Pope offers

kingdom of
Sicily.
1254.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Henry accepts
Sicily on
ruinous terms.</div>
</div>

<p>It has been said that the Pope’s chief object was to remove the
Hohenstaufen from their Italian dominions. As early as 1252,
seeking some prince whom he might set in their place,
and being assured of the fidelity of the English King,
he offered the throne of Sicily to Richard of Cornwall.
That Prince, remembering that Henry, Frederick’s son,
was his own nephew, and too prudent to trust himself blindly to the
Pope, declined the offer. But when young Henry died in 1253, and
Sicily fell into the hands of Conrad and of his half brother Manfred,
the Pope repeated his offer to King Henry’s son Edmund. By him
it was foolishly accepted; Conrad also died, and a great opportunity
was opened for the Pope’s intrigues. There were three parties in
Sicily: the German party, who upheld a son of Conrad, the Italian
Gibellines, who obeyed Manfred, and the Sicilians, who followed
Peter Rufus, the Emperor’s lieutenant. The Pope succeeded in bribing
the leader of the German party, and his views seemed on the
point of realization, when he died. He was succeeded by Alexander
IV., who was reputed a moderate man, but who accepted all the
arrangements of his predecessor. Henry had returned from Gascony,
after a costly visit to Paris, deeply in debt. The Charter of London
was again set aside, and a heavy tallage inflicted; the Jews were
again compelled to pay large sums of money; and the Barons in Parliament
were loudly complaining of grievances, and demanding
the appointment of a Parliamentary Justiciary and Chancellor. In
the midst of all these difficulties, the King was foolish
enough to accept the Sicilies on ruinous terms. Two
hundred ounces of gold yearly, and the support of 300
knights, were to be promised, the expenses of the war to be paid, and
an army at once sent to claim the kingdom. The Pope kept the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
management of this war in his own hands, but the Bishop of Hereford,
Henry’s envoy, was allowed to make the King responsible for
the outlay. The Pope began immediately to send his creditors direct
to Henry, and twice before the end of the year 1256, a Papal Legate
of the name of Rustand had appeared in England, raised money of
unknown value from the English Church, and freed the King from
his Crusader’s oath, that he might employ his forces against Sicily.</p>

length roused
to resistance.</div>
</div>

<p>The English Church was indeed at his mercy. Boniface of
Canterbury lived abroad, and was completely in the
Papal interest, the Archbishopric of York was vacant,
the Bishops of Winchester and Hereford were creatures of the King.
Henry himself was acting in complete harmony with the Pope, who
had several times granted him a tenth from the clergy, and had given
him the incomes of all vacant benefices, and of intestates. The
Church was driven into close union with the rapidly rising baronial
opposition, and was obliged to regard its temporalities as ordinary
baronies. Scotland and Wales were again becoming troublesome,
and the lukewarmness of the English Barons prevented successful
resistance to their inroads. To add to the difficulties of
England, 1257 was a year of fearful want. The weather
was so bad that the harvest stood rotting in the fields even in
November. Wheat rose from two shillings to fifteen or twenty the
quarter. The harvest of 1258 promised to be as bad. Thousands
were dying of hunger.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> And when, in the midst of this misery, the
Pope’s Legate (who in 1257 had stated the amount of debt to the
Pope to be 136,000 marks, and had succeeded in wringing 52,000
marks from the clergy) repeated his demand the following year, and
threatened an interdict unless the debt was at once paid, Englishmen
of all classes felt that the time for action had arrived,
and, taking advantage of the absence of the Earl of
Cornwall, who was abroad attempting to make good his
election to the German Empire, the Barons assembled at a Parliament
held at Westminster determined upon reform.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament at
Westminster.</div>

<p>It was a stormy scene. William de Valence and Simon de
Montfort almost came to blows. William spoke of Montfort as “an
old traitor, and the son of a traitor.” “No, no,” said
Simon, “I am no traitor, nor traitor’s son; my father
was very different from yours,” referring to the constant treasons of
the old Count de la Marche. He then poured out his grievances, the
squandering of the royal property on favourites, the folly, in the face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
of such financial difficulties, of accepting the Sicilian throne, and the
admission of Papal legates to rob the clergy. At length a sort of
compromise was arrived at, and aid was promised if the Pope would
lower his demands, and the King on his side promised reform, a
promise to which several of his chief favourites had to put their
signatures. The King also pledged himself to give full consideration
to the Barons’ demands at a Parliament to be assembled at Oxford at
Whitsuntide, and to leave the question at issue to be decided by a
commission of twelve from either side, whose verdict should be final.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Provisions of

</div>

<p>On June 11th, this Parliament met. It is known by the name of “The
Mad Parliament.” The Barons, of whom there were about
a hundred,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> appeared in arms, under the pretext of the
war with Wales, in reality to overawe the King’s violent step-brothers.
At that Parliament the promised commission of twenty-four was
chosen. The King’s Commissioners, with the single exception of John
of Plesseys, Earl of Warwick, were men pledged to the old evil courses,
either by their relationship with the King or by the favours they
had obtained from him. At the head of the Barons appeared Richard
de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, the natural head of the English party,
and De Montfort, himself indeed a foreigner, but of such high ability
and character that he was indispensable to his party. To these
twenty-four was intrusted the duty of securing reform. They were
not like the twenty-five guardians of the Charter, pledges for the
carrying out of the treaty, but a committee representing for the time
the executive authority of the Crown. These Barons chose a council
of four, John Mansell, the King’s secretary, the Earl of Warwick, and
two Bigods (the Earl of Norfolk and his brother). These in their
turn were to nominate a council of state or executive ministry of
fifteen. The predominance of the baronial party is shown by the
fact that of those fifteen two-thirds were on the Barons’ side.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> This
Council of fifteen produced the Provisions of Oxford, and
appointed new officers. Hugh Bigod was chief justice,
John of Peterborough, treasurer, Nicholas of Ely, chancellor. The
royal castles were ordered to be placed in the hands of Englishmen;
and three times a year a Parliament was to be held, consisting of
the fifteen, and twelve members of the old twenty-four representative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Barons. These are said to be representatives of the commonalty
of England, but it does not as yet appear that the commonalty
meant anything but the baronage. These Provisions were
accepted and sworn to by the King, Prince Edward, and the Barons,
and subsequently, on his return to England, by Richard, King of the
Romans.</p>

</div>

<p>The article which demanded the surrender of castles by foreigners
met with much opposition.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The King’s step-brothers
refused to surrender theirs. Simon de Montfort, as
a foreigner, on the other hand, showed a good example
by surrendering two of those he had in charge.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> When William de
Valence refused this order, “I will have the castles,” said De Montfort,
“or your head.” The threat was too serious to be disregarded; the
foreigners crept off in the night, and went to Winchester, where they
hoped that Aymer de Valence would afford them protection.
The Barons at once pursued them. They were
obliged to yield, and were exiled. The Barons then proceeded to
check the bad government of the sheriffs. Four knights from each
shire (a step towards the coming admission of the lower gentry
to Parliament) were appointed to inquire into the question; and it
was arranged that the sheriffs should be elected yearly. The
Londoners readily accepted the new order of things; and
finally, in October, the Provisions were solemnly proclaimed,
together with the Magna Charta, in Latin, French and
English. In this the King declared his full adhesion to the Oxford
Ordinances. It was countersigned by thirteen of the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'fifteen counsellers'">fifteen

language, and may be regarded as a sign of the real question at

</div>

<p>The <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'fifteen counsellers'">fifteen counsellors</ins> were intrusted with the duty of producing
other reforms before the following Christmas. This they
neglected to do, and it was only in October 1259 that
they produced another series of Provisions. These by no means
answered the expectations of the Barons, and were so moderate that,
after the cessation of the war, they were incorporated in the Statute
of Marlborough, 1267. They were chiefly directed to prevent
encroachments on feudal rights. Prince Edward had earnestly
pressed for the production of these Provisions. He was at this time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
a strong reformer, and it was perhaps on account of the inefficient
character of the reforms now produced, that a quarrel arose between
Leicester and Gloucester, in which, we are told, that Leicester was
supported by Edward, Gloucester by the King. The government was
meanwhile practically in the hands of the fifteen. They
felt that their chief work was in England, and therefore
freed themselves as much as possible from foreign complications.
They made peace with Wales, entirely renounced all
claims upon Sicily, and made a definitive treaty with France. By
this treaty Bordeaux, Bayonne and Gascony, with the addition of the
Bishoprics of Limoges, Cahors and Périgord, which the honesty of the
French King restored, were to be held by England as fiefs of France;
all claim on Normandy, Anjou, Touraine and Poitou was to be given
up; and the King of France promised to give a sum of money for the
maintenance of five hundred knights for two years, to be used only
for the good of England or the Church. This last article proved
afterwards a source of danger to the baronial cause.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Quarrel between

</div>

<p>Their whole government seems to have given satisfaction; but it
was not likely that Henry should calmly submit to their
domination. With the peculiar faculty of making his
religion compatible with bad government and dishonesty,
which was the characteristic of this King, he applied, almost
immediately after the Parliament of Oxford, to the Pope for an absolution
from his promises. A visit twice repeated to the King of
France gave rise to the suspicion that he was concerting measures
with that monarch; and, in 1261, he was certainly fortifying the
Tower. In April of that year an answer of Alexander
IV., entirely absolving him from his vows, reached him.
He ordered it to be publicly read, proceeded to give some castles into
the hands of foreigners, and proclaimed that he would no longer consent
to the restraint imposed upon him. The Barons met at Kingston;
and, unwilling to proceed to extremities, agreed to refer their
differences to the King of France, whose character for honour stood
high, though in this instance rumours were afloat that he was already
pledged to the King’s interest.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The King would probably
not have ventured on this course had not a quarrel
arisen in the baronial party, which deprived them of
their ablest leader. It is not certain what the cause of quarrel was,
but as early as 1259, De Clare and Montfort had exchanged hot
words, and from that time De Montfort had been very much abroad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and the leadership of the baronial party entirely in the hands of De
Clare. In 1262, a second absolution reached the King, and was by
his orders publicly promulgated by Mansell, by the Archbishop
of Canterbury, and by the Bishop of Norwich.</p>

<p>But meanwhile a stronger leader than Richard Earl of Gloucester
had appeared in England, and the King’s attempts at
recovering his authority were peremptorily checked.
The Earl of Leicester, hearing of the death of Gloucester, had returned
from abroad, and found himself the unquestioned chief of the party.
With himself he associated the late Earl’s son, young Gilbert de
Clare, and matters soon seemed to be coming to extremities.
Llewellyn of Wales, apparently in the baronial interest, attacked the
lands of Roger de Mortimer and of that foreign Bishop of Hereford
who had been the King’s agent at Rome. A general persecution
of all those who could not speak English
followed in the border counties. The Bishop of Hereford’s treasures
were seized, and he himself had to fly abroad. At the same time the
Bishop of Norwich, who was disliked for having published the absolution,
was attacked. John Mansell was driven into France; while, on
the other hand, Prince Edward, who had hitherto remained true to the
Statutes of Oxford, was reconciled to his father, and appeared in arms
against the barons. The people of London joined in the general disturbance.
The Queen had to leave London and retire to Windsor.
On her way thither, as she was passing up the river, she was assaulted
and maltreated by the Londoners, an event which Prince Edward is
said not to have forgotten.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">It fails.</div>
</div>

<p>While the parties were thus already beginning to appeal to arms,
in January 1264, the King of France published his
verdict at Amiens. It was entirely in favour of the
Crown, and annulled the Provisions of Oxford, especially
declaring that the King had right to employ aliens as the governors
of his castles. The verdict was clear enough, and Henry believed
that it put him entirely in the right. On the other hand a clause
was added of which the Barons took hold to support their cause. By
this it was asserted that the verdict was not intended to derogate in
anything from the royal privileges, charters, liberties and laudable
customs of the kingdom. With this loophole for variety of opinion, the
award left the main question unsettled, although it enabled a certain
number of those who were pledged to the Provisions, but disliked the
Barons’ rule, to join the King. Among others, his brother Richard,
the King of the Romans, took advantage of this opportunity. Still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
unwilling to press their claims to the uttermost, the Barons offered
to accept the award, excepting only the one clause, which
was in fact the point for which they were fighting, that,
namely, which permitted the employment of aliens. The Londoners
would not even go so far as this.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">War, and battle
of Lewes.
May 14.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">The Mise of
Lewes.</div>
</div>

<p>The King refused their offer, and war became inevitable. It
began by the capture of Northampton by Prince Edward,
and gradually drifted southward, till the two armies met
at Lewes. The King occupied the town, with the castle
and priory; the Barons, the down to the west. The battle ended in
a decisive victory for the Barons. Prince Edward, carried away by
his anger against the Londoners, whom he despised and hated, was
induced to pursue an advantage he had won over them too far.
Richard, the King of the Romans, was misled into an attack upon a
cage-shaped litter, which he believed to contain De Montfort, who
had been wounded by a fall from his horse. De Montfort had purposely
left it in his rear, together with his standards and baggage; it
really contained only four refractory Londoners of the King’s party.
These two errors on the part of the enemy secured the victory to De
Montfort; and when Prince Edward returned from his pursuit, he
found the battle lost, and the struggle only prolonged by the fighting
round the castle at Lewes. De Montfort, evidently the victor, offered
to put an end to the bloodshed by an immediate truce;
and an agreement known as the Mise of Lewes was made,
by which the questions at issue were to be settled by a court of
arbitration consisting of two Frenchmen and one Englishman. The
two Princes, Edward and Henry d’Almeyne, were to remain in captivity
meanwhile, in exchange for their fathers, the King and his
brother Richard, who had been taken prisoners; and the prisoners on
both sides were to be released.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Appointment of
revolutionary
government.</div>

<p>De Montfort was for the time completely master of the country.
He at once proceeded to act with vigour to bring the country into order.
The King’s peace was proclaimed everywhere. The prisoners were
exchanged, and till the open question with regard to the election of
sheriffs should be settled, guardians of the peace were appointed for each
county. In the offices thus created, as well as in those of the King’s
Council, the friends and followers of Simon were put. A Parliament
was then called, which assembled in June, at which it is probable
that knights of the shire were present. At this Parliament
a committee of three was appointed, who nominated
nine others, in whose hands the government was to be
placed. If the nine could not come to agreement, the final decision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
remained with the three, who were the Bishop of Chichester,
Simon de Montfort, and Gilbert de Clare. At the same time the
affairs of the Church were put in order, its grievances being left to
the settlement of three bishops appointed by statute.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Exiles assemble

<div class="sidenotex">Montfort

settlement.</div>
</div>

<p>De Montfort thus seemed in a fair way to make his position durable;
but unfortunately three important men had made their escape from
Lewes:&mdash;these were the Earl of Warrenne, Hugh Bigod and William
de Valence. These three fugitives betook themselves to
Damme, in Flanders, where the Queen, in company
with the exiled foreigners, Archbishop Boniface, Bishop of Hereford,
Peter of Savoy, and John Mansell, had assembled an army of hired
troops. Great preparations were made to meet the expected invasion,
but the winds were so contrary that the ill-provided army, weary of
waiting, separated. The closeness of the danger, however, induced
Simon to send ambassadors to France, to urge on the completion of
the settlement according to the Mise of Lewes. The embassy was at
the same time to try and make terms with the Papal
Legate, who had been quickly despatched to uphold the
cause of so good a vassal of Rome as Henry. They
were unsuccessful in both their objects. The Queen had been
beforehand with Louis, and the Legate, who shortly afterwards
ascended the Papal throne as Clement IV., replied only by excommunication.
The Bull, however, was taken by the mariners of the
Cinque Ports before reaching England, and thrown into the sea; and
the excommunication did not take effect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Royalist
movements on the
Welsh Marches.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, the royalist barons on the Marches of Wales, especially
Mortimer, Clifford and Leybourne, began to bestir
themselves. Some of them even pushed as far as
Wallingford, where Prince Edward was a prisoner, and
attempted, though in vain, to liberate him. The liberation of this
Prince was now the chief object of the royalists, and the pressure
put upon Leicester was so great, that he had, though unwillingly, to
consent to measures which should bring it about. There was indeed
every reason to desire that he should be freed. The part he had
played in the late disputes had been highly honourable; he had
remained true to the Provisions of Oxford, till the breaking out of
the war seemed to render it his imperative duty to assist his father;
and from his subsequent conduct it is plain that, although he must
have disliked the present restrictions upon the royal power, there was
much in the national policy of the Barons with which he sympathized.
All those who resented the assumption of power by Montfort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
while desiring a reform in government, would have found in
him a welcome leader.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament of
1265.</div>

<p>It was principally for this object that the famous Parliament of
1265 was called. To it were summoned only twenty-three
peers, friends of De Montfort, though the great
Northern and Scotch barons, who had strongly supported the King at
Lewes, also received safe conducts. Of the higher clergy there were
no less than one hundred and eighteen, a number by no means unprecedented,
but which seems to show how completely the Church
sympathized with the Barons. There were also knights of the shires&mdash;two
from each county. Even from the time of the commission for
forming the Domesday Book, elected knights had been occasionally
consulted upon the affairs of their county; since Henry II.’s reign,
although they had never been properly summoned to Parliament,
this practice had been more frequent. But the addition of two
burghers from the chief cities was wholly new, and although the
practice was not continued without a break, this, says Hallam, is the
epoch at which the representation of the Commons becomes distinctly
manifest. To De Montfort it was of the greatest importance
that the general acquiescence of all important classes of the country
in his government should be shown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conditions of
the Prince’s
liberation.</div>

<p>The assembly thus formed had first of all to consider what was to
be done with the present insurgents and with the exiles, and, secondly,
on what conditions Prince Edward might be with safety liberated.
On the first point it was decreed that the barons of the Welsh
Marches should be exiled to Ireland for three years, and the fugitives
from Lewes were summoned to stand their trial before their peers, a
summons to which, of course, they paid no attention. The other
question was more important, but the conditions were
finally arrived at on which the Prince might be set at
liberty. There was to be complete amnesty for all that
was past; the King and Prince were never to receive their former
favourites; the royal castles were to be placed in trustworthy hands;
the great charters of liberty were to be again established; the Prince
was not to leave the country for three years, and must choose his council
by the advice of government; and the county of Chester, with its
castle, together with the castles of the Peak and Newcastle, were to be
given up to De Montfort. For this, however, an equivalent was to
be given from De Montfort’s county of Leicester. All these arrangements
were made under the most solemn sanctions. On the last
article much of the abuse of Leicester for avarice and self-seeking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
has been rested. But, in fact, the position of the lands commanding
the Scotch and Welsh borders afforded a sufficient political
reason for requiring their cession. A copy of this arrangement was
sent to each sheriff, and the great charters of liberty publicly read,
with a solemn threat of excommunication against all who should
break them.</p>

</div>

<p>These arrangements tended to the establishment of a peaceful
government and to the healing of faction; but unfortunately there
was constant jealousy of De Montfort among his colleagues,
arising probably in part from his foreign birth
and royal connections, in part from the truly popular
nature of his views, with which the Barons had but little sympathy.
Again, as on a previous occasion, De Clare, the leader of
the English Barons, deserted him, and began to intrigue with his
enemies. At the same time, William de Valence landed in his lordship
of Pembroke. By the instrumentality of Mortimer, Edward made
his escape from Ludlow Castle; and the invaders, the Prince, the
Lord Marchers, and Gloucester opened communications one with
the other. The trick by which Edward effected his
escape is well known. On pretence of racing, he wearied
the horses of his guardians, and then galloped from them on a
particularly swift horse that had just been sent him, which he had
kept fresh. The danger had become so pressing that Leicester
advanced against the invaders in the South of Wales: but while in
that distant corner of the country, the Prince, with the men of Chester,
who willingly joined their old governor, marched down the Severn
and took Gloucester, thus cutting Leicester off from the rest of
his supporters.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Leicester

<div class="sidenotex">Defeat at

</div>

<p>De Montfort at once recognized that Edward was his chief enemy,
and turned back to meet him, at the same time summoning
to his aid his son the younger Simon, who was
with an army at Dover. Had he executed this duty intrusted
to him satisfactorily, Edward would either have been enclosed
between the two armies, or De Montfort largely reinforced. As it
was, he wasted some time at Kenilworth, his father’s chief stronghold,
and foolishly suffered his troops to encamp outside the walls of the
castle. A female spy brought Edward news of his enemy’s
mistake, and a sudden onslaught scattered De Montfort’s
reinforcement in disgraceful flight. Edward tried to check De Montfort’s
return by breaking down all the bridges over the Severn, but a
way was at length found to cross the river about four miles below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Worcester, and the baronial army reached Evesham in the full
expectation of speedily meeting their friends.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of
Evesham.
Aug. 4.</div>

<p>As they marched out in the early morning on the 4th of August,
they saw a well-ordered army approaching, and Leicester’s barber,
who happened to be the longest-sighted man amongst then, at
first recognized all the standards as belonging to young De Montfort;
only after he had ascended a church-tower did he perceive the
emblems of De Clare and Edward mingled with them. De Montfort
was thus greatly outnumbered and surprised. As the enemy
approached in three well-arrayed divisions, “Ah,” said
he, “that arrangement is not your own, I have taught
you how to fight.” Then, as it became evident that he
had neither time nor men to secure the victory, he added, “God have
mercy on our souls, for our bodies are the Prince’s.” The stories
of the fidelity of his party are touching. He begged his partisans to
fly while there was time. They refused to leave him, while his son
Henry begged him to make good his retreat, and leave him alone to
fight the battle. He was not a man to listen to such advice. At
length the assault came. He saw the best of his followers and his son
killed or disabled around him. But still, though his horse was
killed under him, “like a giant,” says one, “like an impregnable
tower for the liberties of England,” says another of the Chroniclers,
he fought on, wielding his sword with both hands, till he fell overpowered
by the assault of numbers. Three hours completed the
battle, which was little else than a massacre. “Thus lamentably fell
the flower of all knighthood, leaving an example of steadfastness
to others. But since there is no curse more baleful than a domestic
enemy, who can wonder at his fall? those who had eaten his bread
lifted their heels against him, they who loved him by word of mouth
lied in their throat.”<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<div class="sidenotex">Dictum of
Kenilworth.</div>
</div>

<p>The victory produced a complete reaction in England. Castle after
castle opened its gates to the royalists. At Kenilworth alone, which
Simon had defended with extraordinary machines which his skill as
an engineer had invented, and in the inaccessible marshes in the East of
England, the baronial party still held out. The conqueror proceeded
at once to act with reckless severity. The whole of Leicester’s
property was confiscated and given to Prince Edward, all his followers
were deprived of civil rights and property, and all acts of the government
since the battle of Lewes were declared null. This was the
work of a Parliament summoned at Winchester, where of course there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
is no sign either of county or of borough representation. After London,
which made some opposition, was conquered, and for
the time disfranchised, all efforts were directed against
Kenilworth. This stronghold had become a centre
from which, as from the Eastern Fens, disorderly bodies
pushed out to wreak their vengeance on the King’s followers. The
defence was heroic. It seemed plain that the reaction had been
carried much too far. One party at all events of the royalists, with
Prince Henry d’Almeyne and perhaps Prince Edward at its head,
desired a more conciliatory policy, and at length, at the end of the
year, a Commission of twelve was established to attempt to produce
peace. Under their management, a Parliament and Convocation was
held, the Magna Charta again acknowledged, even by the Papal
Legate, and those who had been disinherited were allowed to regain
their lands by paying a certain number of years’ income to the new
possessors. The sons of Lord Derby and Leicester were
alone excepted. In accordance with this arrangement,
called the Dictum of Kenilworth, the castle was surrendered.</p>

<p>The insurgents in the Fens afterwards submitted on the same
terms, but not before Gilbert de Clare had again changed sides,
making it plain to the government that however much
jealousy of De Montfort might have broken the baronial
moderate party, the feelings which had dictated the Provisions of
Oxford were still unconquered. Under these circumstances
it was found necessary to take further measures to insure
moderation of government. In May 1267, Magna Charta was again
enacted, and from this time forward kept. The offices were given
into the hands of Englishmen, and Englishmen only. The Sicilian
project had become impossible, indeed the crown had been given
to Charles of Anjou; and, finally, Prince Edward, whose
influence might have been dangerous, had withdrawn
from England on a crusade, and taken many English
nobles with him. The Barons’ war had thus, although in its outward
form a failure, secured its main object&mdash;tolerable constitutional
government, and the establishment of a national rule. In 1272 the
King died.</p>

prominent part as an instrument in the hands of its leaders. There
is much to make us believe, however, that the movement of the
Barons was in reality a national one. More particularly is this
true in the case of Simon de Montfort. He is constantly spoken
of by contemporary writers with admiration. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Il eime dreit, et
att le tort,”</span> (He loves right and hates the wrong), says one poet. “It
should, however, be declared,” says the Chronicler of Melrose, “that
no one in his senses would call Simon a traitor, for he was no traitor,
but the most devout and faithful worshipper of the Church in England,
the shield and defender of the kingdom, the enemy and expeller
of aliens, although by birth he was one of them.” The Londoners
were his devoted adherents, while the character of the Parliament
which he summoned after the battle of Lewes was certainly popular.
It seems fair to believe that he was the unselfish supporter of the
national policy.</p>

<p>Again, all the writers of the time, with very few exceptions,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> whether
chroniclers or poets, were in favour of the baronial party. When
some of the leaders seem flagging in their energy, they were cheered
by such words as these,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">“O Comes Gloverniæ, comple quod cæpisti,</p>
<p class="verse0">Nisi claudas congruè, multos decepisti.”</p>
</div>

<p class="verse0">Observate firmiter illud quod juratis.”</p>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Again, in one political poem of the day we have the question at issue
argued out in a manner which shows the advance of political knowledge,
and in a constitutional tone which would become a modern
Whig. “All restraint does not deprive of liberty. He who is kept
from falling so that he lives free from danger, reaps advantage from
such keeping, nor is such a support slavery, but the safeguard of
virtue. Therefore that it is permitted to a king all that is good, but
that he dare not do evil&mdash;this is God’s gift.... If a prince love his
subjects, he will be repaid with love; if he reign justly, he will be
honoured; if he err, he ought to be recalled by them whom his unjust
denial may have grieved, unless he be willing to be corrected; if he
is willing to make amends, he ought to be raised up and aided by
those same persons.... If a king be less wise than he ought to be,
what advantage will the kingdom gain by his reign? Is he to seek
by his own opinion on whom he should depend to have his failing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
supplied? If he alone choose, he will be easily deceived. Therefore
let the community of the kingdom advise, and let it be known what
the generality thinks, to whom their own laws are best known. Since
it is their own affairs that are at stake, they will take more care and
will act with an eye to their own peace.... We give the first place
to the community; we say also that the law rules over the king’s
dignity, for the law is the light without which he who rules will
wander from the right path.”</p>

<p>That proclamations should be published in English is also a significant
fact, and it may on the whole be considered that this war was
practically the conclusion of foreign domination in England. It
is the great honour of Edward I. to have perceived this so clearly,
that he willingly accepted the new national line of policy which the
Barons had marked out, and he may be regarded as our first purely
national monarch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edward’s
peaceful
accession.
1272.<br /><br />
His journey
home,
1274.</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Edward was still abroad when the news of his father’s death
was brought to him. His accession had been so
long looked forward to as a happy termination to the
difficulties of the last reign, that what might have been a
dangerous crisis passed over peacefully. An assembly was summoned
at Westminster, not only of the nobles, but also of the representatives
of the lower estates, and there an oath of fidelity was taken to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
absent King. Three prominent nobles seem to have assumed the
position of governors; the Archbishop of York, as head of the clergy,
Edmund of Cornwall, the King’s brother, as representative of the
royalty, and Gilbert of Gloucester, as chief of the baronage. Under
them the government pursued its old course. Hearing that things were
going well in England, Edward did not hurry home. He returned by
Sicily and Rome, where he induced the Pope to visit upon the young
De Montforts the murder of Henry D’Almeyne, whom they had
killed at Viterbo. Thence he passed into France, joined in a great
tournament at Châlons, where jest was changed to earnest, and a
rough skirmish ensued, known as the little battle of Châlons. True
to his legal obligations, he did homage at Paris for his French
dominions, demanding what as yet had not been fulfilled, the completion
of the late definitive treaty in France: and after settling,
not without application to the French King as feudal
superior, his quarrels with Gaston de Bearn in Gascony,
and establishing friendly relations with Flanders,
he returned in 1274 to England, and there, on the 18th of August,
was crowned and received the homage of his Barons, and that, among
others, of Alexander III. of Scotland. Shortly after, he appointed as
his chancellor Robert Burnell, who served him throughout his life as
chief minister, while Anthony Beck, Bishop of Durham, was his chief
agent in all diplomatic matters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The importance
of the reign.</div>

<p>From the reign of Edward began what may be properly spoken of
as the <em>English</em> monarchy. The last reign had brought prominently
forward the two great points which constituted the
nationality of the country. Primarily the object of the
baronial party had been to separate England from the overwhelming
importance of its foreign connections, and to prevent it from becoming
a mere source of wealth to foreign adventurers. In this the baronial
party had succeeded. While declaring themselves national, they had
been obliged to have recourse for support to other elements of the
nation than those from which the ruling class had hitherto been formed.
The advance of these new classes had, as has been seen, been gradual.
Already, in earlier reigns, the principle both of election and representation
had been, on more than one occasion, accepted. But it was the
formal admission both of knights of the shire and of burghers to
parliamentary privileges, even though the practice had not been continued,
which rendered it impossible long to ignore the growing feeling
that all classes should in some way be consulted about what
interested all.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">His success.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">His enforced

</div>

<p>Edward was well fitted, both by position and character, to play the
part of the first English king. He had given distinct
proofs in the earlier part of the late baronial quarrels
that a good and national government was what he
desired. But it would be wrong to suppose that he was at all inclined
to what we should now call liberal policy. In the latter part of his
father’s reign he had made it clear that to his mind a strong monarchy
was a necessary condition of good government. It was only gradually,
and in accordance with a love of symmetrical government which
strongly characterized him, that he recognized the advantage
of the complete admission of the hitherto unprivileged
classes to the rights of representation. He set before him as
his object the establishment of a good and orderly government in the
national interests, but carried out by a strong, nay despotic monarch,
subjected only to the restrictions of the law. This is indeed another
prominent characteristic of the King, in which he went along with
the tendencies of the age. His mind was essentially
legal, and just at this time the Roman and civil law were
forcing their way into prominence throughout Europe. In Edward
and his great rival Philip IV. of France, we have, allowing for their
differences in personal character, instances of the same course of
action. They both intended to make use of feudal law, interpreted
more or less by the Roman law, and pressed to its legal and logical
conclusions, to strengthen the monarchy. It is thus that we find
Edward constantly enacting statutes and constitutions, making use of
feudal claims to compel the submission of his neighbours, and
exerting to the full, sometimes even beyond the limits of honesty,
the rights the constitution gave him, but never wilfully transgressing
what he regarded as the law. He was successful in
carrying out the two first branches of his threefold
policy; in the third he failed. Good government he established by
a series of admirable administrative enactments, and by that power
of definition which a living historian<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> has attributed to him, in spite of
the difficulties presented by the independent position of the Church,
and by the disorders still remaining from the late troubled times.
Nationality he was able to foster both by foreign wars and by his
great plan of connecting all the kingdoms of Great Britain. But in
his efforts to establish an absolute monarchy, he was met by the
financial difficulties into which the late reign had plunged the Crown,
and by that entanglement in foreign politics which the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
possessions in France, of which he was not yet quite free, continually
caused. Urged by his wide schemes to have recourse to
arbitrary means for replenishing his treasury, he excited
again an opposition similar to that of his father’s reign, and found
himself obliged to make concessions which effectually prevented any
of his successors from attempting to render the Crown independent.</p>

</div>

<p>The first years of the King’s reign were employed in restoring
order to the government and the finances. His first
Parliament met at Westminster in 1275, where was
passed a great restorative measure known by the name
of the First Statute of Westminster. It was so wide and far-reaching
that it might be called a code rather than an Act. Its object is said
by a contemporary writer to have been to “awake those languid laws
which had long been lulled asleep” by the abuses of the time. It
secured the rights of the Church, improved the tardy processes of
law, and re-established the charters, further limiting the sums
which could be demanded for the three legal aids. At the same
Parliament, an export duty on wool and leather, the
origin of the customs, was granted to the King, the
more readily, perhaps, as his firmness had lately re-established the
wool-trade with Flanders. During the next three or four years other
less popular measures were taken with a view to replenish the King’s
treasury. Commissions were issued to inquire into the exact limits
of the grants of the late King to the clergy, and to inquire into the
tenure of property throughout England, with the twofold
view of establishing the rights of property disturbed
by the late war, and of clearly defining the
revenue due to the Crown.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">New coinage.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Statute of
Mortmain.
1279.</div>
</div>

<p>It was not till the year 1278 that the effect of this commission was
seen. Orders were then issued to the itinerant justices to make use
of the evidence which had been obtained, and to issue writs of “quo
warranto,” to oblige owners to make good their titles. This was the
occasion of the well-known answer of Warrenne, Earl of Surrey, who
presented his sword to the judge, saying, “This is my title-deed, with
this my ancestors won my land, with this will I keep it.” The temper
thus shown by one of his most faithful followers prevented Edward
from pushing matters to extremity. During these years was set on
foot also the practice of demanding that those who were wealthy
enough should receive knighthood. The practice was kept up during
the reign, but the property counted sufficient for the holder of that
dignity varied from £20 to £100 a year. The King’s activity reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
in all directions. Another commission was issued to inquire into the
conduct of sheriffs. The coinage, much clipped and
debased, was renewed; it was ordered that its shape
should always be round, as the prevalent method of clipping had been
to cut the pieces into four, so that the exact edge could not be known.
At length, in 1279, Edward proceeded to regulate one of the great
abuses of the Church. Not only had that body become exorbitantly
rich, but the privileges which it claimed had begun to be detrimental
to the Crown; and when, in the earlier part of the year, Peckham,
Archbishop of Canterbury, produced and authorized, at a meeting at
Reading, some canons tending to the independence of the Church,
the King was determined to strike a blow in return. As corporations
could not die, land which had passed into their possession was
free from the fines and payments due from an incoming heir, which
were thus lost to the feudal superior. Moreover, and this touched the
Crown more nearly, it had become a habit to give property to the
Church, and fraudulently to receive it back again as a Church fief,
and thus free from feudal services. By the Statute of
Mortmain, which was now passed, it was forbidden,
without the King’s consent, to transfer property to the
Church.</p>

</div>

<p>Meanwhile, while Edward had been thus busied at home, affairs in
Wales had begun to attract his attention. Llewellyn had
always been in close alliance with the Leicester party,
and had shown his dissatisfaction at the accession of Edward by
refusing to come to the assembly which swore fealty to the new
King. Edward, who wished honestly to heal the late differences, had
summoned him to his coronation, and had again been refused. Had
he not desired a peaceful solution of the difficulty, he would
certainly now have proceeded to extremities. But no less than six
opportunities were given to the Prince of appearing
in England, to set himself right; on every occasion he
had refused to do so. The suspicions which his conduct
excited received a strong confirmation when it was known that he was
contemplating a marriage with the daughter of De Montfort. It is
probable that this marriage was to be carried out in pursuance of
some scheme for continuing the disturbances of the last reign.
Fortunately the lady was captured, with her brother Almeric who
was escorting her, on her way to Wales. This brought matters to a
crisis. In 1276, Llewellyn, who had refused all approaches to friendship,
demanded, in the language of an independent prince, a treaty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
and the restoration of his wife. In November of that year Edward,
acting in concert with his Parliament, ordered his army
to meet him at Worcester, and the war began. Even the
strength of his country did not enable Llewellyn to hold out against
the superior power and ability of the English King. A fleet of ships
from the Cinque Ports cut him off from Anglesea, and mastered that
island, while the English army forced him back towards the mountains
of Snowdon. He was induced to treat. The
terms given him were stringent. The Cantreds or
Hundreds between Chester and Conway were given up to the
English. Anglesea alone he was allowed to keep in full, on the payment
of 1000 marks, while a few baronies around Snowdon were
left in his hands, to prevent his title of Prince of Wales being a
mere empty honour. Besides this, he had to pay 50,000 marks for
the expenses of the war, and a tribute of 1000 marks. Once conquered,
however, and brought to complete submission,
his treatment was generous. The money payments were
at once remitted. His brother David, his enemy, and a probable
source of discomfort to him, was kept in England and pensioned;
and finally, he came to England, and received his wife, their marriage
being nobly celebrated by the King.</p>

</div>

<p>In less than three years the whole arrangement was again destroyed.
David, though he had fought for Edward and been well rewarded,
suddenly deserted to his fellow countrymen. He attacked
the Castle of Hawardyn, and, in company with his
brother Llewellyn, besieged Rhuddlan and Flint. Edward
at once advanced against them. Hard pressed, the brothers
divided their forces. David continued to fight in the North, while
his brother betook himself to South Wales. He was there surprised,
defeated, and killed, on the River Wye, and his head sent
to Edward, and displayed in London, in scorn adorned with
an ivy crown, in allusion to some prophecy that he should be crowned
in London. David was shortly afterwards compelled to surrender.
A Parliament had been summoned to grant supplies; some difficulty
had arisen, and before an answer could be given, a fresh one was
called at Shrewsbury, (moved afterwards to Acton Burnell, the seat of
the Chancellor,) by which the unfortunate Prince was
tried, and condemned to death. This Parliament afterwards
proceeded to the settlement of the conquered
country, by what is known as the Statute of Wales. By this a
considerable part of English law and English institutions, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
some modifications to suit the prejudices of the Welsh, were introduced.
The conquest was completed by the famous presentation
to the people of the King’s new-born heir, under
the title of the Prince of Wales. There was henceforth
no longer any pretence of feudal supremacy; Wales
was annexed to the English Crown. The following year the
Parliament at Winchester produced the Statute known by the name
of that city, which arranged the defence of the country
upon a national basis. Of that piece of legislation, as
well as of others before and after it, more will be said
by and by. In the year after this, Edward left England, placing
the government in the hands of his brother Edmund.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Foreign affairs
call Edward
abroad.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Sicilian Vespers.</div>
</div>

<p>It will be necessary to turn for a moment to Edward’s foreign
relations to explain the necessity of his journey abroad. He had the
misfortune, like his predecessors, to be master of Aquitaine, and as
Duke of that province a vassal and peer of France. He
was, moreover, cousin of the King of France, and brother-in-law
of the King of Castile. Although a definitive
treaty had been made between Henry III. and the French King, it
had never been properly carried out; Edward had, as in duty bound
done homage for his French possessions, and had from time to time
renewed his claims. He had even been allowed in 1279, in right of
his wife, to take possession of Ponthieu. There was, nevertheless
a constant feeling of distrust between the French King and his too
powerful vassal. Edward had therefore done his best to cement his
friendship on the side of Spain. But, in 1282, an event happened
which enabled him to secure a settlement of his French claims, and
to assume the important position of mediator in a great foreign
quarrel. A war seemed imminent between Castile and France, when
Peter III. of Aragon, for whose favour both parties had been intriguing,
suddenly raised a large army, the destination of which was said to be
Africa, but which shortly after proved to be intended for the conquest
of Sicily from the French. This put an end to the quarrel with
Castile, and brought Aragon forward as the Spanish power against
which the French energies were directed. Charles of Anjou had
received from the Pope the grant of the Two Sicilies when the Barons
of England had obliged Edmund to renounce it. He had made good
his position with extreme cruelty; and now the Sicilian people entered
into that famous conspiracy known by the name of Sicilian
Vespers, and massacred the French throughout the
island. They then proceeded to give themselves to Peter III. of Aragon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
in concert with whom they had certainly been acting. He was successful
in his enterprise. His admiral, Loria, had everywhere defeated
the fleets of Anjou, and in 1284 had taken prisoner Charles, Prince of
Salerno, the Duke of Anjou’s heir. For a short time there seemed
some possibility of the quarrel being ended by a single combat
between Peter and Charles; formal preparations were made, and
Edward was entreated to preside as umpire. But chivalrous though
he was, he was too much of a statesman to give his consent to so trivial
a form of settlement; and, in 1285, Charles died.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">His award is

</div>

<p>His quarrel was taken up by the French King, and matters had
reached this point when Edward thought it necessary to go abroad
(especially as a new King, Philip IV., had just come to the throne),
to arrange if possible a question which, involving not only his own
interests, but also the authority of the Pope, was one of
European interest. He succeeded in inducing Philip
IV. to allow the justice of his claims with regard to the
provinces to be united to Gascony, and proceeded the
following year to act the part of mediator between the Courts of
France and Aragon. He was trusted absolutely in this negotiation,
and after some difficulty hoped that he had arrived at some conclusion,
when he had succeeded in obtaining the freedom of Prince Charles
of Salerno, although the terms of liberation were very
hard. Large sums of money were to be paid, and Sicily
was to be given up to the Spanish Prince, James. But no sooner
was Charles at liberty than he repudiated these conditions; and
Edward, disgusted with his want of faith, and thinking probably that
it was wiser not to plunge too deep into European politics, determined
to return home, neglecting the offered opportunity of forming
an alliance with Aragon, which might have formed some counter-poise
in Southern Europe to the power of France and of Rome.</p>

</div>

<p>His presence at home indeed was much wanted. The moment
the back of the great ruler was turned, and the weight
of his hand removed, it became evident that much
time would be necessary before his arrangements could
restore more than external order to the deeply disturbed society of
England. Fresh disturbances had arisen in Wales, where Rhys ap
Meredith had been roused to rebellion by the strictness with which
the English law was carried out. Nor had the Regent’s army, under
Gilbert de Clare, succeeded in capturing him. It seems indeed that
several of the greater nobles had begun to show discontent, and in
1288, Surrey, Warwick, Gloucester, and Norfolk had all appeared in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
a disorderly fashion in arms. There were other disturbances too in
the lower strata of society. The Statute of Winchester was not yet
fairly in operation, bands of outlaws appeared in the forest districts,
and among others, one Chamberlain had fallen upon a fair held at
Boston in Lincolnshire, and had burnt the town. The
presence of the King restored order, but the fundamental
cause of the misgovernment was laid open to him by his faithful
Chancellor, Burnell. Like Henry II., he had employed as his judges
professional lawyers, and they had not been proof against
the great temptations of their office. The judges were
corrupt, and justice was bought and sold. Very serious charges were
brought against them in October; all except two, who deserve to be
mentioned, John of Methingham and Elias de Bockingham, were
convicted. The chief baron, Stratton, was fined 34,000 marks, the
chief justice of the King’s Bench, 7000, the master of the rolls, 1000;
while Weyland, chief justice of the common pleas, fled to sanctuary,
was there blockaded, and after his forty days of safety had to abjure
the realm. His property, which was confiscated, is said to have
amounted to 100,000 marks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Banishes the

<p>At the same time the King banished all the Jews from the kingdom.
Upwards of 16,000 are said to have left England, nor did
they reappear till Cromwell connived at their return in
1654. It is not quite clear why the King determined
on this act of severity, especially as the Jews were royal property,
and a very convenient source of income. It is probable, however,
that their way of doing business was very repugnant to his ideas
of justice, while they were certainly great falsifiers of the coinage,
which he was very anxious to keep pure and true. Earlier in the
reign he had hanged between 200 and 300 of them for that crime,
and they are said to have demanded 60 per cent. for their loans,
taking advantage of the monopoly as money-lenders which the
ecclesiastical prohibition of usury had given them. Moreover, about
this time, the great banking-houses of Italy were becoming prominent.
With them Edward had already had much business, and their system
of advances upon fairer terms was much more pleasing to him. From
this time onwards the money business of England was in their hands.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">End of First
Period of the
reign.</div>

<p>We have now reached what may be considered as the close of the
first period of Edward’s reign, which had been occupied
by legislation and by the conquest of Wales. From
this time onwards, it is the conquest of Scotland, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the great constitutional effort of the reign, intermingled with foreign
affairs, which we shall have to observe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relations with
Scotland.</div>

<p>It is uncertain when Edward’s thoughts were first directed to the
Northern kingdom, but events had been rapidly occurring,
which threw Scotland almost entirely into his hands.
Quite early in the reign he seems to have wished, as was natural
for one of his legal mind, to have the disputed question of homage
cleared up. Again and again homage had been paid to his predecessors;
but, except in the case of William the Lion’s homage to
Henry II., it had been always open to the Scotch King to assert that
it was for fiefs in England, and not for Scotland, that his homage
was rendered. Even that clear instance had been annihilated by the
subsequent sale of the submission then made by Richard I. It would
seem in fact that the claim to overlordship was really based upon
much earlier transactions. Scotland consisted of three incorporated
kingdoms&mdash;the Highlands, or kingdoms of the Scots, Galloway, which
was part of the British kingdom of Strathclyde, and the Lothians,
which had undoubtedly been a part of the Anglian kingdom of
Northumbria. In the time of the English Empire the King of
Scots and all the people had chosen Eadward the Elder as father and
lord; that is to say, they had what is technically called commended
themselves to the English King. Strathclyde had been conquered by
Eadmund, and by him had been granted to Malcolm as a fief, on condition
of military tenure; while afterwards the Lothians had been
granted by Eadgar to the Scotch kings as an English earldom. Thus,
on various grounds, all parts of the Kingdom of Scotland acknowledged
the English King as their overlord. When England fell into
the hands of the Normans, William, professedly assuming the position
which his predecessor had held, would naturally expect the same
homage to be paid to him. It is equally certain that the Scotch
kings would object to pay it. It had therefore been a constantly
open and disputed question till the time of Edward. Meanwhile the
feudal law, which had not existed at the time of the original commendation,
had grown up and been formulated. Edward, as we have
seen, intended to use it to the full. He therefore desired the uncertain
acknowledgment of the old supremacy to be brought, as it had
never hitherto been, within the precise and clearly-defined limits of
feudal overlordship. The character of Alexander III. was such as to
strengthen such ideas. In 1275, his wife, Edward’s sister Margaret,
had died. The tie of relationship thus broken, Edward had demanded
and received, in 1278, a homage, which he declared to his chancellor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
was complete and without reservation;<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and since that time, more
than once, Alexander had seemed to acknowledge the supremacy.</p>

</div>

<p>But it was the rapid extinction of that monarch’s family which
brought matters to a crisis. Margaret had had two
sons and one daughter, Margaret. Both the sons had
died young, and the daughter had married Eric, King
of Norway, with the promise that she was to retain her rights to the
Scotch succession. In accordance with this, when she died in her
first confinement, her little child of the same name, spoken of as the
Maid of Norway, was, in 1284, declared heiress of the throne. In
1286 King Alexander died. He had married again, but had no
children; the crown would therefore have naturally come to the
Maid of Norway. During her absence, a regency, consisting of the
Bishops of St. Andrews and Glasgow, the Lords Fife, Buchan, and
Comyn, and others, was appointed. But already other claimants had
come forward, and their respective parties had begun a civil war. To
Edward it seemed the opportunity had arrived of establishing his
rights without violence. A marriage between his son and the Maid
of Norway at once occurred to him. For this he had
secretly cleared the way by obtaining from the Pope a
dispensation to enable these cousins to marry. Armed
with this, but acting ostensibly in the Norwegian interest, he contrived
to bring about a meeting at Salisbury between commissioners
on the part of Eric, of the Scotch government, and of himself, at which
it was agreed that the young Queen should be received in Scotland
free of matrimonial engagements, but pledged not to marry except by
the advice of Edward and with the consent of her father. Almost immediately
after this, the plan of the marriage was made public, and
was at once willingly accepted by the Scotch, who were anxious to
be saved from a civil war, but who, while accepting it,
took care, at a parliament held at Brigham in 1290, to
guard with scrupulous care the independence of the
kingdom.</p>

</div>

<p>It was not exactly thus that Edward understood the treaty. He at
once despatched Anthony Beck, Bishop of Durham, to act in unison
with the guardians of Scotland, as Lieutenant of Queen Margaret and
her husband, at the same time demanding possession of the royal
castles, ostensibly for the purpose of preserving the peace of the kingdom.
The governors of the castles declined to give them up, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
seven great Earls wrote to Edward, as though to a superior, begging
him to curb the power of the regency, while, on the
other hand, a member of the regency, the Bishop of
St. Andrews, also wrote, begging Edward to approach the
border to assist in keeping order, and to appoint a king if the rumour
which had been spread of the death of the Maid of Norway should
prove true. The report was true, Margaret had died on
her journey from Norway in the Orkney islands; and
acting on these two letters, which he construed as an invitation,
Edward summoned a meeting at Norham, to be held after Easter
1291. The delay was probably occasioned by a heavy blow which
had fallen on Edward. In November he had lost his much loved
wife Eleanor. It is one of his titles to our respect, that in a licentious
age he was remarkably pure, and that no word was ever
breathed against his perfect fidelity as a husband. After
a period of bitter sorrow, and a pompous funeral, each stage of the
journey being subsequently marked by a beautiful cross, he returned
again in the following year to his Scotch plans. At
that meeting he put forward his claim as superior and
overlord of the kingdom, saying that it lay with him in
that capacity to put an end to discord. He ended by asking that his
title should be acknowledged, in order that he might act freely. A
delay of three weeks was demanded, at which time the assembly
met again on Scotch ground opposite the Castle of Norham. An
answer seems to have been meanwhile sent, but the King had
regarded it as not to the point; and at the assembly itself no
objections were raised to his claim. All the competitors acknowledged
his authority in set words, and the case was put into Edward’s
hands.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">The appeals not

extremities.</div>
</div>

<p>There were a great number of claimants; but three only established
a case worth consideration. These were Bruce, Balliol,
and Hastings. The claims of all these went back to David
I. This king had three grandsons; Malcolm IV., who was childless,
William the Lion, whose direct descendants had just come to an end,
and David, Earl of Huntingdon, from whom all three
claimants were descended. He had had three daughters;
Margaret, the eldest, whose grandson was Balliol, Isabella, the second,
whose son was Bruce, Ada, the third, whose grandson was Hastings.
Besides these three, Comyn was also a grandson of Margaret, but
being a son of a second daughter, his claims were obviously inferior to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
those of Balliol.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> To decide these claims, Edward, as lord superior,
established a great court; forty of Bruce’s friends, forty of Balliol’s,
and twenty-four members on the part of Edward, were to constitute
it. Edward seems to have proceeded with the full intention
of giving a just and legal judgment, and after
several meetings, in November 1292, a decision was
arrived at in favour of John Balliol. Meanwhile, during the settlement
of the question, Edward had taken possession of the Scotch
castles, had appointed the great officers of the kingdom, and had
caused the regents to exact an oath of fealty to him as
superior lord. The new King accepted the throne distinctly
as a vassal of England, and finally, to make his
dependence perfectly clear, did homage after his coronation. He did
not find his new position free from difficulty. He found that the letter
of the feudal law to which he owed his elevation could be turned
against himself. It was indeed unnatural to expect the Scotch
to submit to the inconveniences without claiming the advantages of
that law. Balliol had not been long on the throne before they asserted
that, if he was a vassal, appeals would lie from his
judgments to the English courts. In the following
year two or three such appeals were made, one from a
goldsmith, and one from Macduff, Earl of Fife. When summoned
to appear before the English courts, Balliol refused to
come. He made his appearance however at the Parliament held in
the autumn of 1293, and there declared that, as King of Scotland, he
could not act without the advice of his people. A delay was given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
him for the purpose of consulting his parliament; he did not take
advantage of it. The case of Macduff was therefore given against
him by the English baronage in his presence. He was fined to Macduff
700 marks, to Edward 10,000. On the protest of Balliol, a fresh
delay was allowed, nor does Edward seem to have been
in any way disposed to do more than make good his
legal position. It is plain, however that the position
of vassal king, with its awkward and probably unexpected incidents,
disgusted Balliol; and political events soon enabled him to make his
displeasure felt.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">First true
Parliament.</div>
</div>

<p>Philip IV., the new King of France, was as legal in his mind as
Edward, but more dishonest. It was as plain to him that it was
desirable to unite France by annexing Guienne, as it
was to Edward that it was advantageous to England to
annex Scotland. They set about their designs in somewhat the same
way. The sea was at this time regarded as a sort of no man’s land,
where incessant fighting little short of piracy was allowable. There
were plenty of instances of battles between English and French
merchant-ships. The Normans are said to have infested the whole
coast of France from Holland to Spain. The Cinque Ports mariners
were probably not much behind them. At last a formal meeting was
arranged in 1293, where the matter was to be fought out. An empty
chip marked the point of contest, and there the fleets of France and
England fought a great battle, which terminated in the defeat of the
French. Edward, who knew Philip’s character and the resources of
the feudal law, was anxious to do what he could to clear himself of
complicity in the quarrel; but no representations of his were attended
to by the French King, and Philip summoned him to appear before
the French Parliament. As the English offenders were not given
up, and as Edward declined to appear, the Constable of France took
possession in the King’s name of Edward’s French provinces. With
much more important matters in hand, and with the knowledge probably
of what Balliol’s conduct was going to be, Edward tried all he
could to settle the matter peacefully. He sent over to France his
brother Edmund, whose wife<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> was the mother of the French Queen.
Through the instrumentality of these Queens a treaty was arranged,
by which the summons to Paris was annulled, and a
personal meeting at Amiens arranged, pending which the
strongholds of Gascony were to be put in Philip’s
hands. Edmund withdrew the English army, and dismissed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
commander, St. John, and at the same time demanded a safe conduct
for his brother at the proposed meeting. But Philip refused the
safe conduct, declared himself dissatisfied with the surrender of the
towns, and refused to leave the country which he had occupied.
Fresh insulting messages were sent to Edward, and, in 1294, Edmund
returned to England, and war became necessary. Great preparations
were made; alliances were formed on the north-east of France;
money was granted by Parliament. This proving insufficient, no less
than half their property was demanded from the clergy. An insurrection
in Wales, and the news that an alliance had been formed
between Philip and the Scotch, rendered the preparations useless.</p>

<p>It was plain to Edward that it was worth risking his foreign
dominions to consolidate his power as King of Great Britain. For
the present, therefore, he left Gascony alone, and turned his arms
against Scotland. Engaged at once in a war with France, with Scotland,
and with Wales, he found it necessary to raise supplies from all
branches of his subjects. A genuine Parliament was
therefore called in October, in which all estates were
represented, and which has been considered the true origin of our
Parliament as it now exists. The three Estates granted the supply as
different orders; and it was not without difficulty that the clergy,
suffering from the late enormous exaction, were induced to grant him
a tenth. The other estates seem to have come readily to his assistance
at this great crisis.</p>

<p>In March a large army was assembled at Newcastle, and while the
Scotch crossed the borders and ravaged Cumberland
with savage ferocity,<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Edward pushed forward into
Scotland. In three days Berwick was captured. While
still before that place, he received from Balliol, who seems to have
been under some constraint, renunciation of his allegiance; and
before the end of April brought his army, under the Earl of Surrey
and Warrenne, to Dunbar. The Scotch advanced to meet him,
occupying the higher ground; but foolishly mistaking the movements
of the English army in the valley for a flight,
they left their strong position, and were hopelessly
routed, with a loss of 10,000 men. This battle decided the fate of
Scotland. Several of the great Earls and many knights were taken
prisoners. The King met no further opposition in his march through
Edinburgh to Perth. On the 10th of July, Balliol made his submission,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
was allowed to live under supervision in the Tower of London,
whence he afterwards proceeded to Normandy; and
Edward henceforth acted no longer as feudal superior,
but as King. At a Parliament held at Berwick, he received
the fealty of the clergy, gentry, and barons of Scotland, whose
names, filling thirty-five skins of parchment, are still preserved among
the English archives. Scotland was left as much as possible in its
old condition, but the Earl of Warenne and Surrey was made
Guardian; Hugh de Cressingham, Treasurer; William of Ormsby,
Justiciary; and an Exchequer was established in the English fashion.
At the same time the coronation stone of Scone was removed to
Westminster, where it still is. Edward had thus completed his first
conquest of Scotland. Both legally and politically, his conduct is
justifiable. The consolidation of Great Britain was a most desirable
object. The French alliance, the invasion of England, and the
renunciation of vassalage, constituted by feudal law a sufficient cause
for confiscating the possessions of a vassal prince. But this leaves
untouched the question, how far it is right to annex a free people
against their will? It must be remembered that the submission of
Scotland had been made by the nobility only, who were in fact
Normans, and many of them English Barons.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Refusal of the
clergy to grant
subsidies.
Nov. 3. 1296.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Clergy outlawed.</div>
</div>

<p>Freed from danger on the side of Scotland, Edward was now at
liberty to turn his attention towards France. But his late exertions had
caused great expenditure, to which had been added the subsidies by
which he had been compelled to purchase the alliance of the Princes
on the north-east of France. To meet this necessity, a Parliament
was summoned at Bury St. Edmunds, at which the
Barons and Commons gave fresh grants. But the
clergy, driven to extremity by the King’s late demands
upon them, found themselves in a position to refuse. Benedict of
Gaita had lately been elected Pope, under the title of Boniface VIII.,
and had at once entered upon a policy resembling that of the great
Popes of the twelfth century. He had issued a Bull known by the
name of “Clericis Laicos,” in which he had forbidden the clergy to pay
taxes to their temporal sovereign. Backed by this authority, Archbishop
Winchelsea refused in the name of the clergy to make any
grant to Edward. The clergy, it was said, owed allegiance to two
sovereigns&mdash;the one temporal, the other spiritual. Their obedience
was due first to their spiritual chief. An exemption from taxation
of the Church, which had rapidly been growing enormously wealthy,
would have crippled Edward’s resources. He had already accepted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the principle, that all should be consulted and all pay in matters
touching the advantage of all. He proceeded at once, therefore, to
meet the claim in his usual legal fashion. If the clergy would not
help him, he would not protect the clergy. The Chief Justice was
ordered to announce publicly from the bench in Westminster
Hall, that no justice would be done the clergy
in the King’s Court, but would nevertheless be done to all manner of
persons who had any complaint against them. Nor was this sentence
of outlawry a vain one; the tenants began at once to refuse to pay their
rents, the Church property was seized, and the owners could get no
redress. This severe treatment induced many of the clergy to make
their submission, but the Archbishop still held out.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Edward secures

</div>

<p>Matters thus remained till another Parliament met at Salisbury
in February 1297, when, the Barons only being summoned, the
King explained his plan for the war with France. He was under
pledge to pay subsidies, and to bring an army to his allies in Flanders.
This army he would personally command. He wished his Constable
and Marshall, the Earls of Hereford and Norfolk, to take charge of a
second army destined for Guienne. These two noblemen positively refused.
They had learnt law from their King, and alleged
as their excuse, which was evidently only a technical one,
that they were only bound to follow the King in person.
They then withdrew from the Assembly, which broke up, with nothing
done. The King, in want of money, gave free vent to his arbitrary
temper, seized the wool of his merchants, and ordered large requisitions
of provisions to be made in the counties, for which, however, he promised
future payment. In the following March, Winchelsea had a
personal interview with the King, in which he appears to have
arranged some sort of temporary compromise; for immediately
afterwards a meeting of the clergy was held, in
which he recommended them to act each for himself as best he could.
Determined to proceed in spite of all opposition, the King summoned
the whole military force of the kingdom to meet him at London on
the 7th of July. There the Earls still refused to do their duty, and
fresh officers were appointed in their place. The King reconciled
himself with the clergy, and appointed the Archbishop one of the
counsellors who were to act as advisers to his young son Edward, in
whose hands he left the government. He also induced
those nobles and Commons who were with him, though
in no sense a Parliament, to make him a money grant. They gave him
an eighth of the moveables of the barons and knights, a fifth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
cities and boroughs. This grant was given expressly for a promised
confirmation of the charters. This seems to show what the real point
at issue was. The King’s excessive arbitrary taxation had aroused
the old feeling which had produced the baronial wars of the preceding
reign. The clergy were also asked for a grant in a convocation
held upon the 10th of August. It was there decided that there was
good hope that leave would be given them to make a grant. On this
the King acted, and ordered a levy of what amounted to a fifth on all
their revenue, both temporal and spiritual.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">The Earls demand

<div class="sidenotex">It is granted

</div>

<p>Shortly after this, he received the demands of the refractory Earls,
complaining of the non-observance of the charters, of the tallages,
aids and requisitions, and of the tax on wool. Declining to give an
answer at present, on the 22nd of August he set sail for Flanders.
On the very next day the Earls appeared in the Exchequer Chamber,
and peremptorily forbad the collection of the irregularly
granted eighth, until the charters had been signed which
had been the express condition of the grant. The necessity
for concession had become obvious, and in a Parliament summoned
on the 6th of October, the promised confirmation was given
by the Prince. The Earls, who appeared in arms, with troops,
insisted upon the addition of some supplementary clauses, which have
since been known as the statute “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De tallagio non concedendo.</span>”
They further demanded that the late grant should be considered
illegal; it was therefore cancelled, and a new constitutional grant of
a ninth was made in its place. Prince Edward’s confirmation
was renewed by the King in person at Ghent.
It was again renewed, in 1299, with an unsatisfactory
clause “saving the rights of the Crown,” which the King was obliged
subsequently to remove, and finally, in 1301, at the Parliament
of Lincoln. The charters thus confirmed were the amended charter
of Henry III., the additions to it were contained in the supplementary
articles of the two Earls, which forbid what had hitherto
been undoubtedly constitutional, the arbitrary tallaging of towns
and taxing of wool. They contained however a clause “saving the
old rights of the King,” and Edward took advantage of this afterwards,
in 1304, to continue the old wool-tax and to tallage the towns
in his own domain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Appearance of
Wallace.</div>

<p>It was the dangerous condition of his affairs which induced the
King to yield to the pressure of the Barons; for in the spring of
1297, Wallace had made his appearance in Scotland. The younger
son of a small proprietor in Elderslie, and without means
of his own, he had established his fame as a guerilla
leader. In the woods and mountains he collected a band of outlaws,
with whom he attacked isolated parties of English, all of whom were
at once put to death. His cruelties especially against the nuns and
priests are described as most revolting. Cressingham, Treasurer of
Scotland, foolishly despised him, and thus allowed the insurrection
to gain head. He was joined by Sir William Douglas; but on the
whole was both disliked and despised by the Scotch nobility. At
length, as his followers had increased to an army, and threatened the
fortress of Stirling, it became necessary to take measures against him.
Warrenne, Earl of Surrey, and Cressingham, raised an army, and
advanced to the Forth. The armies met early in September at
Cambuskenneth, near Stirling. The river is there spanned by a
narrow bridge, at the north end of which the Scotch were strongly
posted. With overweening folly, Cressingham insisted on an immediate
advance across the bridge. The natural consequence followed;
when a small portion of the English had crossed, and were thus cut
off from support, the Scotch fell on them and completely routed them.
Warrenne, an old and feeble man, took to hasty flight, and the army
was in fact destroyed. This victory was followed up by a fierce
invasion of the north of England. Wallace seems to have collected
troops by violent means; he then led them across the English border,
and sweeping it lengthwise from Newcastle to Carlisle, “he left
nothing behind him but blood and ashes.”<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> His cruelties were indeed
beyond description, and could not but have filled the English with
horror, something akin to that which the English in India must have
felt at the outbreak of the mutiny.</p>

1299.</div>

<p>Edward’s expedition to Flanders had been a failure. The people
in the cities, angry with his interference in the wool trade, were
opposed to him; his allies had been tampered with by
Philip, who had also won a victory over them at Furnes;
the Pope was urging peace; and Edward, who always
regarded his French affairs as secondary, made a truce before the end
of the year 1297, which two years afterwards ripened under the
arbitration of Boniface to the Treaty of Chartres. By that treaty,
Guienne was restored to the English King, who withdrew his support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
from his Flemish allies; while Philip in return gave up the cause of
the Scotch. The treaty was cemented by a double marriage. Edward
himself married Margaret, the French King’s sister; while his
son Edward was betrothed to Isabella, Philip’s daughter.</p>

</div>

<p>Shortly after his return, Edward advanced to revenge the insults
of Wallace, who had meantime unwisely taken the title of the
Guardian of the Kingdom, thus still further exciting the
jealousy of the nobles. He retired before the English
army, laying waste the country behind him, and Edward
had almost been starved into a retreat, when two Scotch Earls told
him that Wallace was in the woods in his immediate neighbourhood.
Edward at once advanced to meet him. Wallace, with his infantry
formed into solid squares, awaited his attack. Such horse as he had
fled without striking a blow. The arrows of the English archers
broke the squares, and the 7000 heavy armed English cavalry had no
difficulty in completing the victory. Wallace fled, and
resumed his outlaw’s life, nor does he again play a
prominent part in history. In 1305, he was betrayed by one of his
own followers named Jack Short to Sir John Monteith, by whom he
was given up to the English King, and suffered death, with all the
extreme penalties of the law.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The bitter feeling his outrages had
caused in England made any other fate impossible. But though
Wallace sinks into obscurity, his work had not been
without effect. The southern counties were so ravaged
that the King could not maintain an army there, and had to retire
from the country, which passed into the hands of a temporary
regency, at the head of which was Comyn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament of
Lincoln.</div>

<p>For several years the steps taken for the reduction of Scotland
were marked by great weakness. Edward’s energy was paralyzed,
partly by the affairs in France, partly by questions arising with
regard to the charters in England. Frequent complaints had been
raised with regard to infringements of the Charter of Forests. It was
to settle these complaints, and to discuss an extraordinary claim
raised by Pope Boniface, that a Parliament was assembled
at Lincoln in 1301. With regard to the charter the
King yielded, and a considerable disafforesting of districts illegally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
included within the limits of the forests took place. Pleased with the
King’s constitutional conduct, the baronage joined heartily in the
rejection of the Papal claim. Boniface had issued a mandate desiring
the King to abstain from all further attacks on Scotland, “which
did and doth still belong in full right to the Church of Rome.” This
mandate was delivered while Edward was in Scotland, and Boniface’s
position as arbiter between Edward and the King of France prevented
him from at once rejecting it. It is probable that Boniface was
only asserting his position as guardian of international law, but
the English treated the claim as serious. When it was brought before
Parliament, the baronage replied that the kingdom of Scotland never
had belonged to the See of Rome, and that they, the Barons of England,
would not allow Edward, even if he wished it, to surrender the
rights of the Crown. It was not till 1303 that Edward was able to
resume his conquest of that kingdom. Early in that year he ordered
his Barons to assist John Segrave, Governor of Scotland, in marching
from Berwick to Edinburgh. But that General mismanaged his march,
and as he approached Roslin on the way to Edinburgh, in three divisions,
he was fallen upon by Comyn, and his army defeated in detail.</p>

</div>

<p>The King had thus much to revenge when, in June, he began his
march. On this occasion he was accompanied by a fleet
to bring his supplies. He thus avoided the difficulty
which the desolate state of the country had hitherto presented. He
pushed onward into the far North. On returning he took up his
abode for a time in Dunfermline. Most of the Scotch Barons there
sought and obtained pardon, and at length Comyn, who had been the
leader of the rebellion, made a treaty in Fife, by which the Lords
agreed to suffer any pecuniary fine Edward thought fit, and the
castles and government were to be in Edward’s hands. One stronghold
only refused to obey this treaty. Sir William Oliphant held
the fortress of Stirling, and it required three months to
reduce its gallant defenders to submission. This was the
last opposition Edward had to fear; he at once admitted the Scotch
to pardon, and settled the country, placing his chief confidence
apparently in Wishart, Bishop of St. Andrews, John de Mowbray
and Robert Bruce. It was soon seen how little reliance could be put
on the first and last of these Commissioners.</p>

<p>Robert Bruce was the grandson of the claimant of the Scotch
throne; his grandfather had been an English judge, his father a
constant friend of Edward. It was only by marriage that the family
had acquired the estates of Carrick and Annandale. He was therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
to all intents and purposes an Englishman, or rather a Norman
Baron, possessed of that peculiar characteristic of the race which
rendered it in fact a race of adventurers, with the constant hope of
winning great things before their minds. The instances of Norman
Barons who had won earldoms, kingdoms and empires, were too
numerous not to have had effect upon aspiring members of the race.
Bruce had up to this time played a somewhat vacillating game, but
on the whole, perhaps because of his feud with Balliol, he had
remained faithful to Edward. He seems now to have thought his
opportunity had arrived. It may perhaps have been the King’s
growing infirmities that encouraged him. At all events,
early in February 1306, he murdered in the church of
Dumfries Comyn, who, in accordance with the interpretation
of the law which Edward had recognized, stood next to the
Balliols in succession to the Scotch throne, and who, since he had last
submitted to Edward, had been true to him. Bruce then, joined by
a few nobles, raised the standard of revolt. He proceeded at once to
Scone, and there, in March, was crowned by Wishart and other of
Edward’s Commissioners. This unexpected insurrection from those
whom he had trusted roused Edward to extreme anger. With great
pomp, at a meeting at Westminster, he knighted his son, and took a
solemn oath to avenge John Comyn’s death. Carlisle
was the point of rendezvous, but already Bruce had been
defeated at Methven near Perth by Aymer de Valence, Earl of
Pembroke, and was wandering barefoot and in misery among the
hills and woods of the country. He was reduced to demand the pity
of the King, but was refused; and a severe ordinance was issued that
all abettors of the murder of Comyn should be hanged, and that all
those who assisted Bruce should be imprisoned. The ordinance was
carried out with severity. Nigel Bruce, two Seatons, the Earl of
Athole and Simon Fraser, were all executed, and the Countess of
Buchan, who had crowned Bruce, was imprisoned, with ironical
cruelty, in a crown-shaped cage. But Bruce himself was not taken,
and issuing from his fastnesses, he inflicted many losses by surprise
upon the English. He even in his turn defeated the Earl of Pembroke,
and shortly after the Earl of Gloucester; and
Edward was rousing himself to attack him, though
scarcely able to mount his horse, when he died upon the march.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Constitutional
importance of
the reign.</div>

<p>The mere narration of the political facts of the reign, although it
brings out prominently much of Edward’s greatness, gives no idea
of the real constitutional importance of his work. Not only was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
he the first truly English King, both by his circumstances and political
views, but he became, in virtue of his love of order and
legal arrangement, the completer of the English Constitution.
In the first place, it is to him that we owe the perfection
of the Parliamentary system, of the complete representation
in Parliament of the three Estates of the realm, the Lords, Commons,
and Clergy. For it is plain that it was his intention to combine the
three, although the clergy refused to accede to his wish, and preferred
to tax themselves separately in Convocation; a body which however, as
will be afterwards seen, also owes its representative arrangements to him.
The gradual introduction of the representative system of the counties
has been mentioned. Again and again, on special occasions, knights,
to represent the shire and to give information with regard to their
counties, had been summoned. Simon de Montfort had even introduced
representation of the boroughs; but this was regarded as wholly exceptional.
Nevertheless, Edward was not long in seeing both the justice
and advantage of the system. In the first Parliament of his reign,
when enacting the first great Statute of Westminster, a healing and
restorative measure applicable to the whole country, he said that he
made it with the consent of the <em>commonalty</em>; there were possibly
representatives of the counties present; more probably their consent
was arrived at in some other way. At the same time, the high view
which he took of his own constitutional position is marked by a change
in the ordinary form of enactment. Statutes had hitherto been enacted
“by the counsel and consent of Parliament.” The alteration of a few
letters changed the meaning of this phrase. The present statute was
said to be enacted “by the King by the advice of his Council and the
assent of Parliament.” The legislative power was thus made to reside
in the King and his Council. It is the power thus claimed which
gave rise to the legislative, or rather the ordaining power claimed by
the King in Council, which was afterwards frequently complained
of by the Parliament. But Edward, in spite of these pretensions,
accepted the view that all should be consulted where the interests of all
were at stake. This was of course chiefly in the matter of taxation,
and the convenience as well as the justice of the method which Simon
de Montfort had set on foot soon became evident to his mind.
From the beginning of this reign, the method of taxation had been
changed. Instead of an aid, raised from the land, it had become a
subsidy raised by an assessment on the moveables of the people.
Most frequently the proportion granted was a tenth or fifteenth, but
in these early times every variety of proportion was granted. As yet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
however, these taxes had been collected locally in accordance with
arrangements made by Exchequer officers, sheriffs, or the county court.
In 1282, the King, being in want of money for his Welsh wars, proceeded
by his ordinary method. The sums raised locally were insufficient;
while his Barons were with him at the wars it was inconvenient to
hold a Parliament; writs were issued therefore to the sheriffs and
archbishops to collect their two Estates, the Commons and the clergy,
at two centres, York and Northampton. At these meetings were present
four representative knights from each county, and all freeholders
of more than one knight’s fee. The Commons made their grant of a
thirtieth. The assemblies of the clergy declined, until the parochial
clergy were represented. For this purpose the election of Proctors
was then ordered, and they have since formed a regular part of the
Convocation. These negotiations were not completed when what
is called the Parliament of Acton Burnell was summoned to settle
the affairs of Wales. At that meeting there were present no clergy,
and representatives of twenty towns only, summoned separately.
In 1290, a further proof is given that for taxation by subsidy the
representation of the Commons was beginning to be considered
necessary. In that year an old-fashioned feudal aid was granted for
the marriage of the King’s daughter. It was granted by the baronage
for the whole commonalty, and was in the old form of land-tax,
but the Commons being subsequently present, it was changed
at their request to a fifteenth. It was possible for the baronage
to grant the aid upon military tenants, but the rest of the
people could not be reached. Two principles had by this time been
established,&mdash;that the clergy should be fully represented, and that
for subsidies upon the whole kingdom it was both convenient
and just that the Commons should in some way be represented;
but it was not yet held necessary for feudal matters, or for questions
touching the baronage only, that the Commons should be
present. Indeed, at this very Parliament, the statute “Quia Emptores”
was passed by the Barons before the Commons assembled.
All these preparatory steps found their completion in the Parliament
of 1295, when writs were issued to the Archbishops to appear
themselves, and to send Proctors to Westminster; to the Prelates and
Barons, as Peers, and to the sheriffs, summoning the knights of the
counties, and two burghers from each town.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> There was thus a
Parliament complete in all its parts, such as it has since remained.
We must not suppose, however, that the Estates acted in common, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
that the Commons had much voice in the deliberation. At this very
Parliament of 1295, the grant of each order was different, nor was it
till 1318, in Edward II.’s reign, that the Commons can be considered
as perfectly incorporated in the Legislative Assembly. The constitutional
view at present was, that the King, with the assent of
his Barons, granted the petitions of the Commons and the Clergy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Great statutes
of the reign.</div>

<p>The great statutes which were passed in these various Parliaments
must now be mentioned. Those which were of most general
national interest were the First Statute of Westminster,
which, as has been before said, revived and re-established
the old constitutions of the country, and limited the
employment of feudal aids; and the Statute of Winchester, passed
in 1285, which was a re-enactment and completion of the Assize
of Arms established by Henry II., and aimed at once at the defence
and police of the country. It laid upon the counties, under heavy
penalties, the duty of indicting felons and robbers, ordered the
police arrangements of walled towns, the enlargement and clearing
of the edges of public roads, and further defined the arms which
each class of the population was bound to procure for the preservation
of the land. Constables and justices were to be appointed
to see to the proper observance of this statute, from whom subsequently
grew the justices of the peace. Some such statute was
indeed very necessary, and even its stringent provisions were not
sufficient to establish order. In 1305, England was full of riotous
outlaws, who were willing to hire themselves out for purposes of
private outrage when they were not plying their own trade of
robbery; these were known by the name of “trail-bâtons.” To
suppress them it was found necessary to issue commissions to
travelling justices, empowering them to act summarily towards such
breakers of the peace. Their strictness is mentioned in the political
songs of the day. It was impossible, it was said, any longer to beat
your children, you were at once punished as a trail-bâton.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Even the
stringency of these measures of suppression mark Edward’s love
of order. Lastly, must be mentioned the great Acts for the confirmation
of the charters, which are sometimes regarded as the statute “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De
tallagio non concedendo.</span>” From this time forward arbitrary tallages,
though occasionally used, began to be regarded as illegal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>There were also two great statutes bearing almost entirely upon
the feudal relations of landed proprietors. The first was the statute
of “Quia Emptores” (1290), which forbad subinfeudation and
the formation of new manors. Its original object was to prevent feudal
lords from being defrauded of their dues. Henceforward, property
alienated ceased to belong in any sense to the subordinate grantor, and
returned to the property of the lord superior of the whole estate. The
effect, unforeseen by the enacters, was to increase the number of independent
gentry holding immediately from the crown or from the great
lords. The second statute is known by the name of the Second Statute
of Westminster, or “De donis conditionalibus.” When an estate had
been given to a man and to his children, it had hitherto been held
sufficient that the child should be born. The estate had then
become the absolute property of the man to whom it had been
granted, and he could alienate it at his will. It was now enacted
that he had but a life interest in it, that if his children were not
living at his death, it reverted to the original grantor. Thus was
established the power of entail. There remains one great statute to
be mentioned, the Statute of Mortmain. This was aimed against the
increasing power and wealth of the Church, and against a legal trick
by which laymen had freed themselves from feudal liabilities. It had
become a custom to give property to the Church and to receive it
back as tenant of the Church, thus freed from obligation to lay
superiors. At the same time, even though this device was not used,
the accumulation of property in the hands of the Church withdrew it
from many feudal duties. It passed, it was said, “in mortuam
manum”&mdash;into a dead hand. All transactions by which lands or
tenements could in any way pass into mortmain were now forbidden.
The same spirit which produced these laws had been felt in the administration
of justice, where the three courts of Exchequer, King’s Bench
and Common Pleas were finally separated, and each provided with a
full staff of officials. Even from this short sketch of the work of
Edward I. may be gathered the great constitutional importance of
the reign.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">The reign of Edward II. affords the best apology for any
excessive exertions of power which can be laid to the charge of
Edward I. It is plain that there existed a readiness on the part of
the nobles to take advantage of any weakness in the government of
their ruler; on the part of the clergy to reclaim the liberties of their
order; and of the lower classes to find a popular hero in every
opponent of the government. It would seem indeed that there was
no alternative between a strong and practically despotic government
and anarchy. It was not till the feudal barons of England had had
their fill of anarchy in the Wars of the Roses, and had destroyed themselves,
that constitutional government, in our sense of the word, had
a chance of existence, and our sympathies are constantly divided
between the Church and barons, whose efforts alone promised freedom,
and the power of the encroaching ruler, who alone ensured order.
For the weakling who could secure neither one nor the other we can
feel no sympathy. In the reign of Edward II. we feel as if we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
fallen back again to the time of his grandfather. The great question
at issue throughout is the same&mdash;Shall foreigners, or indeed any other
king-chosen favourites, supersede the national oligarchy of great
barons? The constant prominence of this question (which in the
present reign was further embittered by the personal character of one
at least of the favourites) renders it very difficult to distinguish the
part played by real patriotic demands for good government and for
constitutional limits to the royal power. It is pretty clear that the
favourites were the chief cause of the disturbances of the reign; but,
on the other hand, the evident advantages offered by some of the
baronial claims, and the love of the populace, who ranked even
Lancaster with its saints, compel us to believe that these turbulent
disturbers of the peace were worthy of some sympathy.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Edward’s
friendship for
Gaveston.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Barons demand
his dismissal.
March 3, 1308.</div>
</div>

<p>When the late King died in the neighbourhood of Carlisle, he
believed that the war with Scotland would have been carried on by
his son, of whom he was very fond; while he thought he had secured
him from that danger which he had already foreseen would beset his
reign, by insisting on the dismissal of his favourite, Piers Gaveston.
Gaveston was a young man of Gascon or Basque origin,
of greater refinement apparently than the rough barons
of England, their equal, if not their superior, in martial
exercises, and possessing those courtly tastes for music and the arts
which marked the young King. But Edward disappointed his
father’s hopes. He had already (before his father had insisted on the
dismissal of Gaveston) gone so far as to beg for him, though in vain,
the royal county of Ponthieu. On his father’s death he immediately
recalled him. A hasty and ineffectual march into Scotland, where
Aymer de Valence was left as lieutenant, was all that came of the
great preparations at Carlisle, and the King’s mind seemed to be
occupied in lavishing favours on his friend. He gave him the Earldom
of Cornwall, hitherto an appanage of some royal prince. He
seized the property of Walter, Bishop of Lichfield, who in the late
reign had opposed him in his office as treasurer, and bestowed it on
Gaveston; and after that young man had, by his ostentation, by his
success in the lists, and by a reckless use of his happy gift of applying
nicknames, excited the anger of the great nobles, Edward was foolish
enough, on leaving England to do homage for his French dominions,
to leave him as Governor of the country. Consequently, no sooner
was he crowned than the Barons demanded in Parliament
the dismissal of the favourite. The demand could not
be refused, and Edward promised to accede to it, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
proved at the same time how determined he was to evade his promise,
by not only bestowing fresh grants on Gaveston, but by appointing
him Lord Deputy of Ireland. There for a year he reigned with
almost royal power.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gaveston’s
return.</div>

<p>The quarrel thus begun became the chief question of the reign. All
other matters, even the conquest of Scotland, were subordinated
to it; and while it was continuing, Bruce was quietly subduing
fortress after fortress, and subjugating the whole south of Scotland.
In the following year, the King still further showed his untrustworthiness
by receiving Gaveston back in England. He
met him with great marks of affection at Chester, having
probably had recourse already to that dangerous expedient, a
Papal dispensation from his promises. In fact, again like his grandfather,
Edward found it expedient throughout his reign to keep on
very friendly terms with the Pope, and to back his authority by the
undefined power which the Head of the Church still wielded. It has
been seen how even his great father was unable to resist this temptation.
Clement V., an obsequious servant of the French King, and
reigning at Avignon, was very different from the formidable Boniface
VIII. There was no difficulty in persuading him to renew the old
alliance with the sovereign which placed the Church at his mercy.
Moreover, at this time he was anxious, in the interests of his master,
to procure Edward’s co-operation in the unprincipled destruction of
the order of the Temple. Philip IV. of France, urged by an avaricious
desire to confiscate the vast property of this order, had set on
foot the most extraordinary reports of their licentiousness and blasphemy.
In October 1307, all their establishments were laid hands
on, the inmates imprisoned, their wealth confiscated. He then, in
union with the Pope, begged all his neighbours to adopt a similar
course. Edward II. consented, and in January 1308, all the Templars
in England were imprisoned. They were tried by the Church on the
accusation of the Pope. In France, torture, and the skill of Philip’s
lawyers, had produced certain confessions, on which the King acted,
and the Order was there destroyed, its Grand Master, James de Molé,
being burnt as a heretic. In England, not even torture, which was
now first used,<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> could produce any important revelations. The inquiries
lasted till 1311. Eventually, certain supposed proofs of heterodoxy
having been produced, some of the Knights were confined in monasteries,
the Order suppressed, and their property given to the Hospitallers.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">General
discontent
and Statute
of Stamford.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Appointment of

Ordainers.</div>
</div>

<p>The effect of Gaveston’s return, and the renewal of Papal influence,
was of course to increase the discontent, till, on the 27th
of July, at a Parliament held at Stamford, the King
was compelled to give his consent to a statute of reform.
By this the first Statute of Westminster was renewed, the undue
power exercised by the constables of the royal castles, and the extortions
of the officers of the royal household, were checked; all old
taxes upon wool and hides beyond the legal customs were removed;
while, at the same time, a general letter was directed to the Pope,
begging him to abstain from his exactions. The storm continued to
rise. Very shortly after this, the great Earls of Lancaster, Lincoln,
Warwick, and others, refused to appear at a meeting at York, if
Gaveston were present. A meeting summoned in London at the
beginning of the following year met with no better success. The
Barons threatened to appear in arms if they appeared at all. The
King, in fear, concealed Gaveston for a time; the Barons then indeed
came, but came only to demand a complete reformation in the
government, to which the King was compelled to give his consent.
The precedent in his grandfather’s reign was then followed. From
the present March to Michaelmas of the following year
the government was placed in the hands of a commission
of twenty-one members, who were to produce ordinances
of general reform. Pending the production of these ordinances,
some preliminary articles were at once established. For the payment
of the King’s debts grants were to be recalled, and his expensive
housekeeping was to be limited. To satisfy the national feeling, and
in the hope of lightening the taxes, the Italian house of the Frescobaldi,
who had hitherto farmed them, was to be deprived of that advantage,
and Englishmen alone were to be employed in their collection;
and before all things, the charters of liberty were to be observed.</p>

</div>

<p>Hoping, probably, to gain popularity for himself and his favourite,
and to be thus able to get rid of the Barons’ interference, Edward
determined on an expedition to Scotland; but the great
Barons, on the plea that they were busied with their
ordinances, refused to accompany him. Some of his
immediate adherents, such as Gloucester, Warrenne, his half-brother,
Thomas, Earl of Norfolk,<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and Gaveston, alone went with him. His
hopes of gaining popularity by victory were disappointed. The
Scotch retired before him. Though Gaveston crossed the Forth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
he could not bring on an engagement; and when the English
retreated, the Scotch hung upon their rear, and pursued their advantages
into the county of Durham. In his necessity, the King was
driven to illegal actions. He appropriated the property of the Earl
of Lincoln and of the Bishop of Durham, and taxed the province of
Canterbury. The Parliament, therefore, was in no improved temper
when Edward, leaving Gaveston in the protection of Lady de Vescy,
went to meet it in London in October. The Ordinances
were there produced. In addition to the articles already
granted, there were others which seem to explain the policy of the
opposition, and to show the chief forms of misgovernment
at that time prevalent. No war was to be carried
on without consent of Parliament;&mdash;taken in connection with the
conduct of Bohun and Bigod in the last reign, with the abstention of
the Barons from the war with Scotland, and with the treaty between
Bruce and Lancaster, which will be afterwards mentioned, this
seems to show that the Barons desired a complete settlement of
England before engaging in foreign wars. All taxes upon wool and
other exports since the coronation of Edward I. were to be removed:&mdash;the
Barons seem to have seen that export duties are a tax on production,
and are advantageous in the long run to foreign manufactures
only. The great officers of state were to be nominated with consent
of Parliament; while, to complete the system, the sheriffs, whom
Edward I. had made elective, were to be nominated by these great
officers; in other words, the royal power was to be restricted by a
baronial oligarchy. Parliament was to be held at least once a year,
which, considering that his father had held at least three Parliaments
a year, seems to show a tendency on the part of the King to arbitrary
government. Bad companions were to be removed from the King,
and his household reformed. Many of these companions are mentioned
by name, and appear to have been foreigners. The King’s
tastes had collected around him foreigners connected with display of
the arts, and on them he had lavished favours, which excited the
national feeling. But the chief attack after all was upon Gaveston,
his countryman De Beaumont, and his sister, Lady de Vescy. It was
ordered that Gaveston should leave the kingdom by the
port of Dover on the 1st of November, and never
again enter any territory belonging to the English Crown.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In pursuance of these Ordinances, Gaveston left England, and took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
refuge in Flanders. But before the year was over he again appeared
in England, and joined Edward as he hurried to the North, to be, as
he believed, less within the reach of his enemies. At Knaresborough,
Edward thought himself strong enough to put forward
a proclamation declaring the banishment of Gaveston
contrary to the Constitution. He readmitted him to
favour, and restored him his property. It was even reported that he
was intriguing to secure him a retreat in Scotland. This flagrant
violation of his word set all England against the King. The old
Archbishop Winchelsea of Canterbury, as in the last reign, became a
centre of revolution; he excommunicated Gaveston, while the
Barons, at the head of whom were now the Earls of
Lancaster and Hereford, proceeded to take active measures.
This Lancaster was the eldest son of Edmund, brother of
Edward I. His power in England was enormous; he was Earl of five
counties. From his father he had received Lancaster and the
confiscated estates of De Montfort and Ferrers, the Earldoms namely
of Leicester and Derby; he had married the heiress of the De Lacys,
and upon the death of the Earl of Lincoln had succeeded to the
Earldoms of Lincoln and Salisbury. He began that opposition,
which will be frequently mentioned afterwards, of the younger
branch of the Plantagenets to the reigning house. Hereford, the
son of the great Humphrey Bohun, was the hereditary chief of the
baronial party. He had married Elizabeth, the King’s sister. The
leaders of the baronial party agreed to repair to those parts of
England where they had most influence. Lancaster proceeded northwards
so rapidly, that the King had to fly before him, and was nearly
captured at Newcastle, where Gaveston’s jewels and horses fell into
Lancaster’s hands, and thence he took ship for Scarborough. Lancaster
took up his position in the middle of England, while the rest
of the baronial party besieged Gaveston in that fortress, where he was
soon obliged to surrender. This he did to the Earl of Pembroke,
who was no enemy to the King, upon a promise that if he could not
come to terms with the Barons he should be restored to Scarborough.
Pembroke persuaded him to go with him to his castle at Wallingford,
but on the way, during a temporary absence of Pembroke, he was
surprised by Warwick, who hated him for having nicknamed him
“The Black Dog,” brought to his castle of Warwick,
and there beheaded on Blacklow Hill. The King was
naturally full of anger, nor did he, in fact, ever forgive
Lancaster, but he yielded to necessity, being perhaps in a particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
good humour at the birth of a son and heir; and the Barons, who
appeared in arms at Ware, all received pardon in exchange for some
slight concessions, among others for the restoration of Gaveston’s
jewels. It was not, however, till the close of the following year that
the pardons were completed, Edward having in the meantime been
to France.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Renewal of war
with Scotland.
1314.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Battle of
Bannockburn.</div>
</div>

<p>This closes the first period of the reign, but it is plain that the
Barons were not yet satisfied. Their chief enemy was removed, but
their policy was not accepted. Thus, when in 1314 the
King collected a large army, many of them still held
aloof, though they sent their forces. If Scotland was to
be saved it was time for energetic action. One by one the fortresses
had been taken. Stirling still held out, but the Governor promised
to capitulate unless relieved before St. John’s Day. By a rapid
march Edward reached the place before the fatal day. But Bruce
was ready to receive him. He had arranged his troops a little to the
south and east of the castle, with his right resting on the
little brook Bannockburn. His position was carefully
prepared. His front was partly covered by a marsh, and where this
ceased and waste land began he had dug shallow pitfalls, with
a pointed stake in each, to check the advance of the heavy cavalry,
of which the English army then consisted. His left was defended by
the cliffs of the castle. Edward Bruce commanded the right, Thomas
Randolf the left, Walter Stewart and James Douglas the centre,
a small rearguard was commanded by Bruce himself. On the eve
of St. John’s the English attempted to secure Stirling, but were
beaten back by Randolf. On the morning of the 24th of June, the
Abbot of Inchaffray said mass in the Scotch army. As they knelt,
Edward exclaimed, “See, they beg pardon.” But Ingram of Umfranville,
a Scotch nobleman, by his side, replied, “Yes, sire, but of
Heaven, not of you.” Immediately after this the battle began, and
already the weight of the English men-at-arms and the flights of
arrows were thinning the Scotch ranks, when Bruce fell upon the
flank of the archers with his reserve. The fortune of the day was
still doubtful, when troops were seen advancing with flying standards
behind the Scotch. They were the camp followers of Bruce’s army,
who were eagerly pushing forward to watch the fight, but the English
believed it was the arrival of reinforcements. They had already
found enough to do, and did not wait the new arrivals. The flight
soon became a disorderly rout. The horses stumbled and fell in the
pitfalls or stuck fast in the morass, and the Scotch pursued ruthlessly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
With difficulty the King, under the guidance of the Earl of Pembroke,
escaped from the field, and sought safety with a few hundred
men in Dunbar, whence he took ship to Berwick. The Earl of
Gloucester, with great numbers of Barons and Knights, were left dead
upon the field, and during the retreat the Earl of Hereford was
captured at Bothwell. He was subsequently exchanged for the
Bishop of Glasgow and Bruce’s wife and daughter, who had long
been in honourable custody in England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edward refuses
to treat. Consequent
disasters.</div>

<p>Edward thought for a moment of renewing the war, and again
summoned a fresh army; but the condition of England
rendered further action impossible. The discontented
Earls attributed the disaster to the refusal of the King
to accept the Ordinances, and to the influence of his new favourites
Beaumont and Despenser. Money, too, was wanting; and the King’s
renewed efforts to obtain it from the clergy by means of the new
Archbishop Walter were met with firm opposition. But though war
was useless, he would not listen to Bruce’s overtures for peace,
obstinately refusing to regard that Prince in any other light than that
of a rebel. The North of England was thus left open to the fierce
inroads of the Scotch.</p>

</div>

<p>The loss of the English prestige was more disastrous than the
immediate loss of the battle. The Welsh and Irish
thought their opportunity had arrived for obtaining their
independence. The Welsh insurrection was indeed subdued after a
year of fighting; but it required three years before Ireland was again
secured to the English Crown. In that country Edward I. had done
but little. It was in its usual state of disorder. The feuds among
the Norman adventurers, to whom the conquest had been left, were
scarcely less constant or bitter than the wars among the native tribes
who surrounded them. Against these tribes, however, they exercised
the greatest cruelties. To be an Irishman was to be excluded from
all justice, to be classed at once as a robber and murderer. The news
of the Battle of Bannockburn induced the Irish to beg the assistance
of Bruce, and to offer him their crown. He declined it for himself,
but his brother Edward, as ambitious as the Scotch King, accepted
the offer. In May 1315 he landed, supported by the
great tribe of the O’Niells, and probably also by the
Norman Lacys, and was victorious over the combined
forces of the Butlers and De Burghs. In vain did Edward send
John of Hotham, a clergyman, to attempt some combination among
the English and the Irish tribes. The English dislike to the royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
lieutenant Butler prevented union, and in May 1316, O’Niell of Tyrone
gave up his claim to the Irish throne to Edward Bruce,
who was crowned King. But a series of separate attacks
upon the natives was more successful. At Athenry the
O’Connors were almost exterminated. The arrival of King Robert in
Ulster, and a march in winter to Limerick and Dublin, produced no
permanent effect, and at length, in 1317, Roger Mortimer, landing
with a considerable army, succeeded in establishing some order. The
Lacys were executed for treason; the tribes began quarrelling among
themselves; and finally, in 1318, Edward Bruce fell in
a battle, in which he was defeated by John of Birmingham,
in the neighbourhood of Dundalk. The English government
was re-established in all its oppression.</p>

</div>

<p>Meanwhile, England itself had been in a miserable plight. 1315
and 1316 were years of fearful famine. Prices rose to
an unprecedented height. Wheat was sold for 40 marks
a quarter; and Parliament still further aggravated the evil by
fixing a maximum price, which for a time closed the markets
altogether. Terrible diseases followed in the wake of the famine.
Again and again the northern counties were mercilessly ravaged;
whole districts and dioceses were glad to compound with the Scotch
for safety. An attempt was made by a Parliament in this year to
re-establish the national prosperity, by obliging the
King to accept Lancaster as his chief minister. Lancaster
accepted this position, upon the condition that he
should be allowed to resign if the King refused to follow his advice,
or if men objectionable to Parliament were admitted to the King’s
Council. For a moment there was peace. The Ordinances were
accepted, and ordered to be published throughout the country. But
it was not in the King to act honourably when the fortunes of his
favourites were at stake; and Lancaster soon found himself thwarted
by the ever-increasing power of the Despensers. It was
in vain that Pope John XXII. was called in as a mediator.
His legates were equally unsuccessful in their attempts to
heal the domestic quarrels of the country and to establish a truce with
Scotland. Bruce refused to treat unless he was acknowledged as
King. He continued his enterprises, and captured the town of
Berwick. The legates could do nothing but put him under the ban
of the Church.</p>

</div>

<p>At last, in 1318, a crisis was reached. The necessity of union
against Scotland began to be obvious. The Despensers were for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
time removed from England, and a committee in the interest of
Lancaster was appointed to watch the royal action in the intervals
of Parliament. This temporary adjustment of affairs
in England was followed before long by a truce with
Scotland. Edward tried and failed in an attempt to
regain Berwick. Another furious invasion had ravaged the North of
England, in which no less than eighty-four towns and villages were
burned. It was plain that the Scotch were too strong for him. At
the same time Bruce was anxious to be rid of the excommunication,
and agreed to waive his claim to the
obnoxious title. Under these circumstances there was
no difficulty in treating.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Despensers

</div>

<p>It soon became evident that the late attempts at compromise between
the two parties in England were hollow. The question had to be tried
by an appeal to arms. Nothing could induce the King to get rid of
his favourites, nor the opposition to act in common with them. It
was a little private quarrel, and no great question, which
at length blew the smouldering discontent to a flame.
The marriage of young Hugh Despenser with the
daughter of the Earl of Gloucester, who had died at Bannockburn,
had introduced a new and objectionable power into the midst of the
Welsh Marches. A quarrel arose about a vacant fief, and the
Marchers made common cause against the favourite. The King
ordered the question to be settled before his own court,
and subsequently before Parliament; but Hereford refused
to appear unless the Despensers were removed.
As the King vindicated his favourites, and refused to remove them,
Hereford marched northward, joined Lancaster, and made a formal
agreement with him that there should be no peace till
the Despensers were gone. The confederates came in
arms to the Parliament held at Westminster, found
themselves completely master of the King, presented him with eleven
articles of reformation, and procured from him, irregularly, and in
spite of the protestations of the clergy, the condemnation
and banishment of the Despensers. This condemnation
was afterwards formed into a statute, and a pardon given to
all those who had compelled the King to grant it.</p>

</div>

<p>But though Edward had temporarily yielded, parties were so
evenly balanced that very little turned the scale. Young Despenser
was serving as admiral on the coast of Kent. He was therefore safe
from such personal attacks as Gaveston had been exposed to, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
King was able to repair to the coast and concert measures with him.
As the Queen was travelling from London to Canterbury to meet him,
she was refused admittance to the royal castle of Leeds by the
Governor, Badlesmere. Angry at this insult, the King
attacked the castle and hanged the garrison. It seems
to have been felt that, in insulting the Queen, the opposition
party had gone much too far. The King was able to recall
the Despensers, several of the nobles declared that the late sentence
of banishment had been procured by overwhelming force; and as he
marched towards the West against the Welsh Marches, his brothers,
the Earls of Norfolk and Kent, and several others of the
greater nobility, followed his standard. By occupying
the valley of the Severn, he separated the Marchers from
Lancaster, who was collecting troops at Doncaster. Mortimer and
most of the Marchers came to terms, and surrendered. Hereford
with several others, broke through the royal army, and joined Lancaster.
The King’s enemies were now collected into one body, and he
rapidly turned against them. To secure support, and probably in
pursuance of their usual policy, the rebel lords had entered into a
treaty with the Scotch. Bruce was to come to their assistance, but
no conquests that he should make were to be permanent. The price
of his help was to be peace, and the acknowledgment of his royal
title.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Defeats

</div>

<p>On the approach of the King, the rebels fell back, and were intercepted
at Boroughbridge by Sir Andrew Harklay, Governor of
Carlisle. On attempting to cross the bridge, Hereford
was killed from below; while the fords were so strongly
guarded that the passage of the river seemed impossible.
Lancaster, with some hundred barons and knights, surrendered. He
was taken to Pontefract. The accusations against him, including his
treasonable compact with Bruce, were stated before a committee of the
King’s Barons, and condemnation passed against him unheard. He
was beheaded, with all circumstances of indignity. A considerable
number of barons suffered either with him or immediately after.
Thomas of Lancaster appears to have been an ordinary feudal party
leader, with a policy which was directed chiefly to domestic reforms
and to the curtailment of the royal power. At the same time, the
commonalty of England must have understood that, however selfish
that policy might have been, it yet led, in the existing
state of society, to improvement in the condition of the
lower orders. Not otherwise can we explain the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
that miracles before long were worked at the tomb of Lancaster, and
his memory so worshipped and honoured by the people, that the King
found it necessary to surround the place of his execution with armed
men.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Triumph of the

<div class="sidenotex">Renewal of war

<div class="sidenotex">Peace for

</div>

<p>The triumph of the Despensers seemed complete. The elder of
them was made Earl of Winchester. Their policy too
was at once adopted. The Ordinances were revised,
all that could touch the King’s prerogative was cut out. It
was ordered especially that hereafter no baronial committee should
dictate laws to the King, but he “should make all laws concerning
the estate of the crown or of the realm in Parliament, with the
consent of the prelates, earls, barons, and universality of the realm.”
The two years’ truce being now out, the King marched
to Scotland, but, like all others of this reign, the
expedition came to nothing. No important battle was fought.
Want of food compelled the English to return, followed by
their indefatigable enemies. So close were they upon their heels,
that at a place called Byland, in Blackmoor Forest, Edward was as
nearly as possible surprised. So unexpected was the attack, that
treason was at once suspected. To the astonishment of all, Sir
Andrew Harklay, who had been made Earl of Carlisle for his services
at Boroughbridge, was proved, for some unexplained
reason, to have been in correspondence with Bruce. For
this treason he was executed. Such constant failures became ridiculous,
and at length, Edward, acknowledging Bruce’s title as King,
made a treaty with him for thirteen years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dangers
surrounding
the King.</div>

<p>It seemed for the moment that Edward’s troubles were over.
The baronial party was crushed, their intercourse with
the Scotch had damaged their reputation; the assumption
on their part of the sole power of legislation had
produced some reaction. The truce with Scotland had secured
Edward from danger from the North. There seemed no reason why
he and his favourites should not rule almost as they wished. In
fact, however, the crisis of his reign was approaching; dangers surrounded
him on every side. That the baronial party was still alive
and active was soon made evident by a plot to liberate all the
political prisoners. The plot indeed miscarried, but Mortimer
found means to make good his escape from the Tower, and, taking
refuge in France, became a centre round which disaffection might
gather. Want of money, too, was a constant source of danger; while
the meagre grants made by Parliament showed how general was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
national feeling against the government of the favourites. Nor was
the Church in much better temper than the Barons and the Commons.
On more than one occasion the King had quarrelled with the national
Church, which found an active, able, and somewhat unscrupulous
champion in Adam Orleton, Bishop of Hereford. This man had
been deeply implicated in the baronial movements, had been deprived
of his temporalities, and thus became a determined enemy of the
King. While quarrelling with the national Church, Edward had
shown no vigour in opposing Rome. On two occasions he failed in
procuring the election to bishoprics of his nominees, and yielded
without a struggle to the authority of the Pope. But submission to
Rome had now become a sure way of gaining unpopularity both
among clergy and laity. On the death of Boniface VIII., the grandeur
and independence of the old Papal system had come to an end, but
its constant demands upon the national churches were by no means
lessened; and such exactions had become more intolerable now that
the ill-gotten wealth which they supplied found its way into the
hands of a Pope holding his court at Avignon, a mere creature of
the French King: to the old dislike of Papal supremacy there was
now added the national dislike of France.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">The Queen and

1326.</div>
</div>

<p>To crown Edward’s difficulties, he found himself involved in a dispute
with France. In 1322, Charles IV., son of Philip the
Fair, had ascended the throne. It at once became evident
that he intended to pursue his father’s policy. He demanded
personal homage from King Edward. His ambassadors could
procure nothing but the threat that, unless it was paid, Guienne would
be seized. In the little town of Saint Sardos, in the Agenois, a quarrel
between the people and their English Seneschal brought the matter
before the French King. He summoned Edward before his court. It
was clear that the old machinery of feudal supremacy was again to be
set in motion. War in fact actually began; the French armies captured
Ponthieu and the Agenois. It was in vain that King Edward offered
justice to the aggrieved inhabitants of Saint Sardos in his own courts,
in vain that he sought the mediation of the Pope. He was himself
entirely in the hands of the Despensers; and those noblemen, afraid
probably to allow the King to get beyond the reach of their personal
influence, used all their power to prevent him from going himself to
France. It was at last decided that Queen Isabella,
the French King’s sister, should go to Paris, and try if
she could come to some arrangement. She procured
leave for her eldest son Edward to represent his father, and do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
homage for Guienne. But, when the young Prince reached Paris,
he was in no haste to return. In fact, the Queen had fallen in love
with Mortimer, and had passed entirely under his influence and that
of the other baronial exiles; and under the skilful management of
Orleton, Mortimer and his friends were engaged in a great conspiracy.
It was in vain that the King perpetually wrote to demand her return.
She pleaded personal dread of the Despensers, and complained of the
King’s ill-usage. For a woman living in adultery with her husband’s
enemy, such charges are perhaps not worth much; but it does seem
probable that as a high-spirited woman she had much to bear from
the King’s partiality for his favourites, many of whom were men of
the lower ranks of life.</p>

</div>

<p>The conspiracy was so widespread, and so judiciously managed,
that her cause was soon regarded as a national one. Nobles, clergy,
and commonalty seem alike to have been in her interest. At the
instigation of the Pope, she was obliged to leave Paris, but she took
the opportunity of going to Hainault, and there contracting a
marriage between her son Edward and the daughter of the Count,
and of engaging that Prince to assist her in her enterprise. On
the 24th of September she landed with her foreign
auxiliaries at the mouth of the Orwell. She was
joined by the King’s brothers, by his cousin Henry of Lancaster,
and by all the nobility of the East. The Archbishop of Canterbury
supplied her with money. London rose in her favour. The
skilful management of the Bishop of Hereford won her allies on
all sides, and the King found it necessary to fly before
her advance. Leaving the Earl of Winchester in Bristol,
he tried with young Despenser to reach Lundy Isle in the Bristol
Channel. The wind prevented him, and he was driven to land in
Wales. Bristol was taken by the Queen without a siege, and the
King finally fell into the hands of his pursuers in Wales.
He was put into the charge of Henry of Lancaster,
brother of the late Earl, at Kenilworth. William Trussel,
whom the Queen had made her judge, superintended the trial of the
Despensers and their friends, and they were all put to death. In
December the Parliament met at Westminster, and swore fealty to the
Queen and Prince. The Bishop of Hereford put the question
whether Edward or his son should henceforward rule. The assembly
declared for the Prince, who accepted the situation, binding
himself to six articles, which seem to represent the
complaints against the King, and which laid to his charge, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
rule of favourites, the contempt of good advice, the loss of Scotland,
acts of violence against the clergy and the nobles, and the refusal of
justice. Isabella pretended to be angry at this act of deposition, but
her pretence could deceive nobody. Finally, a deputation
waited upon the unfortunate Edward, and procured
his resignation. He was hurried from fortress to fortress, and before
long met a cruel death in Berkeley Castle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character of
the opposition.</div>

<p>Throughout the baronial efforts of the reign, constitutional views
and personal interests had been closely interwoven.
The single-minded patriotism of Simon de Montfort
had been entirely absent. It was the personal ambition of a Prince
of the blood, of enormous wealth and influence, which had supplied
the baronial party with their first leader. The vindictive feelings
of personal dislike had produced an unjustifiable murder of the royal
favourite. Success had been followed by an unconstitutional appropriation
of all the powers of government. To support their supremacy
the Barons had not shrunk from an alliance with their national
enemies. To secure a second triumph and revenge they had adopted
the cause of an adulterous Queen and her worthless favourite. Yet
throughout, the pretence of their action had been the maintenance of
the old constitution, and the act which closed the reign was a formal
declaration on the part of Parliament of a constitutional right of the

<div class="sidenote">Measures of
reform.<br /><br />
Mortimer’s
misgovernment.</div>

<p class="drop-cap">As the conquest of England by Queen Isabella and Mortimer
had been ostensibly undertaken for purposes of
reform in the government, and freedom from the influence
of favourites, the first measures taken were such
as might befit a reforming party. The charters of liberty were
solemnly renewed, and the removal of the more obvious abuses
promised, the judgment against Lancaster and his friends was reversed,
and the government nominally placed in the hands of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
council of regency, formed of four Bishops, four Earls, and six Barons.
Nevertheless, the real power remained in the hands of Mortimer; to
him and to the Queen a considerable portion of the royal revenues
were diverted, and before long all trace of reform had disappeared,
and Mortimer, forgetful of the pretext which had secured
him his position, and of the fate of his predecessors, became
to all intents and purposes himself a favourite, giving to that
word the meaning which best describes it, an irresponsible and all-powerful
minister. He even surrounded himself, we are told, with a
guard of 180 knights, and altogether adopted an ostentatious bearing
which could not but create enemies; at the same time his connection
with the Queen excited the displeasure of all respectable men.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Fruitless
campaign
against
Scotland.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Peace.</div>
</div>

<p>His early government was rudely interrupted by an invasion from
Scotland. The truce was not yet expired, but the opportunity was
too good to be lost. To the English the renewal of war
was distasteful, and measures were taken to avoid it.
A meeting was arranged with the Scotch King, but the
conclusion was so evidently foregone, that Robert summoned his
army to assemble on the very day appointed for the meeting,
and while the negotiations were still going on, the Scotch crossed the
borders in force. The campaign against them was not successful.
More used than the English to rapid movements, capable of living
upon much less, and able to supply themselves with that little from
an enemy’s country, the Scotch constantly avoided a great battle.
Twice was Edward deceived by a simple stratagem of the Scotch,
who left the watchfires burning, while they secretly decamped, and
he was finally obliged to close the campaign without a battle. It
became necessary for Mortimer and Edward to treat, and the Queen
offered her daughter Jane as the price of peace. In March 1328, that
peace was concluded; Robert’s son, David, was to marry Jane; the
English were to use their best endeavours to have the ecclesiastical
censures which hung over Bruce removed, and on the
payment of £20,000, promised to give up all claims
upon the Scotch crown, and to acknowledge Bruce as king.</p>

<p>Though the English nobles had long disliked the Scotch war, and
had at all events made use of their pretended dislike as a weapon of
opposition to the government, they now, with true party spirit, and
moved probably more by dislike to Mortimer than by any patriotic
feeling, declared themselves horrified at the disgraceful treaty, and
held aloof from the Parliament which ratified it. Dislike to the
government was in truth growing to a head. Associations were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
formed to uphold the ordinances of the last reign. At length, at a
Parliament called at Salisbury, to be present at the creation of new
peers&mdash;when Mortimer was made Earl of March; Prince John, Earl
of Cornwall; and James Butler, Earl of Ormond&mdash;Prince Henry of
Lancaster, the brother and successor of Earl Thomas, and other malcontents,
refused to appear. Shortly afterwards it was heard that
they were in arms at Winchester. The King’s uncles, the Earls of
Kent and Norfolk, had hitherto supported Lancaster, but as Mortimer
drew near with his army, they suddenly deserted him. This caused
the failure of the insurrection, and Lancaster and his friends were
obliged to submit to hard terms, purchasing their freedom with half
their incomes, and the pledge that they would no longer oppose the
government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conspiracy and
death of Kent.
1330.</div>

<p>It is not to be supposed that this ineffectual insurrection put an
end to the discontent. During the whole of the following year,
while Edward was absent in France, rumours began to prevail that
the old King was still alive, and in the Spring Parliament of 1330,
the country was astonished by the sudden apprehension of Edmund,
Earl of Kent, the King’s uncle. He and many other
nobles, among others the Archbishop of York and
Bishop of London, had undoubtedly joined in a conspiracy
nominally for the restoration of the late King. The examinations
made it evident that this insurrection had been fomented by
the agents of Mortimer, and that Kent had fallen a victim to their
machinations. He confessed his complicity in the scheme, and was
beheaded. Mortimer doubtless was glad of the opportunity of thus
weakening the party of his enemies. Among the petitions of the
Commons in the first Parliament of the reign was one against the
exactions of the royal Princes; this renders it probable that they
had taken upon themselves to exact purveyance, and Mortimer
might rely upon the popular feeling being with him in this act of
violence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edward
overthrows
Mortimer.</div>

<p>But a more important enemy now made his appearance. Edward,
who had been married to Philippa of Hainault in 1328, had now a
son, afterwards the Black Prince, and therefore could not but
feel that he had reached man’s estate. He was weary of the
domination of Mortimer, and could hardly have looked with favour on
the man who had killed his father and his uncle, and was now living
in adultery with his mother. He determined to assume
the reins of government, and, in alliance with the Barons,
suddenly seized Mortimer during the sittings of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Parliament at Nottingham, and procured his speedy trial and execution.
To the Queen he acted firmly but mercifully; he allowed her
£3000 a year; he subsequently even increased this income, and during
her lifetime paid her a yearly visit of ceremony, but he refused to
allow her any influence in the government, and she passed the
remaining twenty-seven years of her life in privacy at Risings Castle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edward’s healing
measures.</div>

<p>The young King was satisfied with the vengeance he had taken,
and proceeded by acts of leniency to heal party feeling,
restoring the forfeited inheritances to the sons of those
who had lately suffered, and extending his kindness to the wives even
of Mortimer, and Gournay his father’s murderer. He made common
cause with those nobles who had hitherto been discontented. Henry
of Lancaster became a prominent member of his council; the great
seal was placed in the hands of John of Stratford, the author of the
bill of deposition in the last reign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Balliol invades
Scotland.</div>

<p>Edward’s attention was almost immediately drawn to Scotland.
Robert Bruce had died in 1329, leaving his son David
still a child, so that the government fell into the hands
of a succession of regents. Scotland had <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'been so closly'">been so closely</ins> connected
with England, that many barons held property in both kingdoms.
During the war of independence, these properties had naturally been
confiscated on both sides. At the peace of 1328 they should have
been restored. On the part of Scotland this was not done. The
party of Balliol and of Comyn was by no means extinct, and the
disinherited lords gathered round Edward Balliol, the son of John,
who thus became the head of a formidable body of men, whose
interests were strongly opposed to the government of the Bruces. They
suddenly determined on an expedition to restore if possible Balliol
to the throne. Sailing from Ravenspur in Yorkshire, Balliol and his
friends landed at the mouth of the Tay, defeated, with much loss,
the Regent at the battle of Duplin, pushed onwards towards Perth,
and, while his English ships annihilated the Scottish squadron in the
river, was crowned at Scone; thus in seven weeks from the time he
left England he had apparently secured the crown. His repulse was
almost as rapid as his success. In three months the friends of Bruce
had rallied, and Balliol, unable to make head against them, had
been driven from the country.</p>

</div>

<p>Edward, while ostensibly discountenancing Balliol’s movement
in England, had, in truth, determined to make use
of his success; and a treaty was arranged between
them, by which Balliol promised to own the supremacy of England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and to give up Berwick, while the two kings were mutually to
defend each other against all enemies. He made a show of deferring
the question first to Parliament, and upon failing to obtain an
answer, to the judgment of the Pope and the French King. But
there were seldom wanting excuses for a war with Scotland. Border
disturbances speedily arose, and in 1333, acknowledging the treaties
he had made, he advanced to the siege of Berwick. Archibald
Douglas, the then Regent, came with an army to relieve
this important fortress. To oppose him the English had
taken up a strong position to the west of their lines
upon Halidon Hill. A swampy ground was before them, and as the
Scotch knights fell into disorder in the marsh, the English archers
“made their arrows flee as thick as motes on the sunne-beme.” It
was in vain that the nobility bravely attempted to storm the hill.
They were defeated with fearful loss, the Regent, four Earls, the
prime of their nobility, and 30,000 common soldiers fell upon the
field. On the following day Berwick opened its gates. Balliol
proceeded to take possession of the kingdom; fortress after fortress
fell; the young King David was taken to the Court of Philip VI. of
France, and found refuge in Chateau Gaillard in Normandy. As the
price of his assistance Edward received the oath of fealty
from the Scotch, and the part of Scotland to the east of
Dumfries and Linlithgow. As long as Edward was not
otherwise employed, Balliol remained upon his throne; but events
soon occurred abroad which called the English King away, and
Balliol was again driven from his kingdom.</p>

</div>

<p>As early as 1329, on the death of Charles the Fair, the third and last
of the sons of Philip IV., Edward, the son of the daughter of that
King, laid claim to the French throne.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> His rival was Philip of
Valois, the son of Charles of Valois, Philip IV.’s brother, and, granting
the existence of the Salic law, the undoubted heir; for all the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
last kings had died without male issue. Edward’s claims then rested
upon three principles; females were excluded from the
French throne, or Joan, Queen of Navarre, daughter of
Louis X., would have succeeded. The male issue of such females
were not excluded; but, thirdly, they must be born during the lifetime
of their grandfather, or else the children of the daughters of the
three last kings would have a better claim than he had. The question
had been properly tried by the Peers of France, and Philip
of Valois had been declared King, and in 1331 Edward had himself
done homage to him for Guienne. There was however a standing
quarrel with regard to certain towns of the Agenois which Charles IV.
had conquered. These, Edward understood, were to be
restored to him, while Philip VI. declined to surrender
them. This quarrel might perhaps have been passed over, but the
reception of David on his flight from Scotland, and the assistance
which Philip gave to the party opposed to Balliol, by degrees
rendered war inevitable; and when once this became obvious, it was
clearly good policy on the part of Edward to make his claims as
national as possible, and instead of trusting to such
secondary causes of hostility as were afforded by Philip’s
refusal to surrender a few unimportant towns in a distant
dependency, or his intrigues for the restoration of the Bruce
dynasty, he at once, with the consent of Parliament, asserted his claim
to the French throne.</p>

</div>

<p>There was at present in England a Frenchman whose influence is
said to have had much to do with determining Edward to this step.
This was Robert of Artois. On the death of his grandfather a dispute
had arisen as to the succession of the country. The fief did not follow
the ordinary feudal custom, but fell to the nearest of blood. Matilda,
the daughter of the late Count, therefore succeeded in preference
to her nephew Robert. Philip V. had married her daughter, and
during his lifetime and that of his two brothers, Robert had been
compelled to be content, but on the accession of Philip of Valois he
demanded restitution. During the trial which ensued he produced as
evidence charters which were proved to be forgeries, and in 1337
took refuge in England, where Edward adopted his cause, and used
him as a sort of set-off to David Bruce, whose cause the French King
had taken up. The great war with France was a distinct breach in
the policy of Edward I. But the present King was not the great
statesman his grandfather had been. A false chivalry had gradually
been taking the place of the old feudal sentiment, and Edward was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
open to be moved both by the impulses of a spurious knight-errantry
and by personal motives of ambition and passion. When once
engaged in the war, however, he acted both energetically
and prudently. His marriage with Philippa of Hainault,
and the close commercial interdependence of England
and the countries on the North-east of France, gave him an
opening which he eagerly employed. He entered into alliances with
the Princes of that neighbourhood, with Brabant, Gueldres, Juliers
and Cologne. In Flanders, where the great mercantile cities were at
enmity with their count, who was on his side supported by the French
influence, he allied himself heartily with James Van Artevelt, the
Brewer of Ghent, the acknowledged chief of the burgher party. He
took advantage also of the fierce dispute at that time raging between
the Emperor Louis of Bavaria and the Pope, who was a mere creature
of the French crown, to secure not only the Emperor’s
friendship but the title of Imperial Vicar. This title gave
something of a national character to that alliance of German Princes
which he had arranged. But all these alliances, though they promised
so fair, were both expensive and hollow. In every case they assumed
the form of subsidies, the foreigners promising to supply troops in
exchange for English money. On the other hand, Philip, although
unable to take actual possession, took seisin of Guienne, that is, he sent
an officer to each of the great towns, and declared that he had taken
possession of it. He had also, as was natural in the disturbed state
of Germany, found some friends in that country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Great taxation.</div>

<p>Edward had set himself right in the eyes of his people by a public
declaration of the state of affairs; and relying on the good feeling
thus established, and on the favour of the mercantile classes, whose
interests he had forwarded by his efforts, though often mistaken ones,
to improve the growth and manufacture of wool, he
proceeded to raise taxes with an unsparing hand. Not
content with the subsidies granted him, he laid tallages on the towns,
collected forced loans, induced Parliament to grant him half of the
last wool crop, even seized large quantities of wool for which he
promised to pay in the course of two years, and laid an extra tax of
40s. the sack on the cost of exportation. He thus obtained abundant
money for his present need, although he found he had gone rather
too far, when, in the following year, Parliament petitioned for the
removal of the “Maletolte,” or additional wool tax.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1338 he landed with a large army in Flanders, where the people
who had lately driven away their count, and were anxious to secure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
for their cities the monopoly of the English wool trade, received him
gladly. But all his efforts came to nothing. He could
not bring the French King to an engagement, and shortly
became aware of the instability of his foreign allies; in
spite of his title as Imperial Vicar they were little inclined to follow
him, and speedily found pretexts to desert him. He had
to retire to Flanders, but by no means lowered his tone.
On the contrary, at the instigation of the people there,
he now first took on himself the title of King of France. But he had
now to return to England to collect fresh supplies. These were
granted him freely, the Parliament giving him the ninth lamb, the
ninth fleece, and the ninth sheaf. His back was no sooner turned
than Philip began to attack Flanders, and with the aid of the Genoese
collected a considerable fleet to prevent his return. On the 24th of
June, the English fleet, with Edward on board, found
the French at Sluys, where a great sea-fight took place,
ending in the complete destruction of the French. They
had fought in three lines, connected by chains, imitating as far as
possible a land army. The English, after a little manœuvring, had
fallen upon them thus huddled together, had thrown them into inextricable
confusion, and driven many of the crews in their terror to
seek refuge by leaping overboard. So great was the disaster, that
none but the jester durst inform Philip of it. “What cowards those
English are,” said he, “they had not the courage all to jump overboard
as the French did.” In spite of this glorious beginning of the
campaign, the year was as unfruitful as the last; simultaneous
advances on St. Omer and Tournay both proved
failures. Philip, who had been intriguing with the
English allies, knew better than to come to a fight, and Edward
was not sorry to conclude a truce at the instigation of Jane of
Hainault, the sister of Philip. This truce, signed at Esplechin in
September, was to last till the following midsummer, and comprehended
the allies of both parties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sudden visit to
England and
displacement of
ministry.</div>

<p>Edward’s position was most irritating; his allies were deserting
him; in spite of his stringent exactions, his finances were exhausted;
he was so deeply in debt that the Flemings, who regarded his
presence as a security against France, kept him as it were in pledge.
He could not bring himself to believe in such complete failure of his
hopes. He was easily led to listen to evil counsellors, who whispered
to him that his ministers at home were defrauding him in the matter
of the taxes. Suddenly, he set sail with a few of his most trusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
friends, leaving behind him some nobles in pledge to his creditors,
and arrived in London in the dead of the night of the 30th of November.
He immediately displaced his ministry, his Chancellor,
his Treasurer, the Master of the Rolls, and imprisoned
several of the judges and officers of the Exchequer.
On the bishops he could not lay hands; they claimed the
privileges of their order. However, commissions of inquiry were
issued to find charges against the late government, new sheriffs were
appointed, and, apparently in mistrust of clerical influence, Robert de
Bourchier was appointed chancellor.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Dispute with
Stratford.
1341.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Edward yields.</div>
</div>

<p>As had happened so frequently before in English history, the
champion of liberty was found in the ranks of the Church. The
President of the Council, John of Stratford, Archbishop
of Canterbury, retired to his See, and thence wrote to
Edward at length, refusing to answer to the charges
brought against him, except before his peers in Parliament. At the
same time he warned the King to remember his father’s fate, and
begged him not to act as he was now doing against the Charter. He
wrote also to the new officials, declaring that the late grants had been
given under conditions which must not be broken, that they were
to be collected only from those represented in Parliament, and not
from the clergy who were not represented there, at the same time
threatening with excommunication all who should disturb the peace
of Church and State. In vain the King threatened; his want
of money compelled him to summon a Parliament (April 23).
An attempt was still made to exclude the Bishops. Whenever they
appeared they were refused admittance to the Parliament, and
directed to the Exchequer Chamber. At length the baronage grew
thoroughly angry, and the King was compelled to admit the Archbishop,
but at the same time left the House in anger, and betook
himself to the Commons. The Peers were firm in their demand that
no Peer should be tried except by his peers in Parliament. At last
the King yielded. All the Estates joined in begging
him to admit Stratford to his favour, and promising him
in exchange for this submission assistance in his necessities. Large
help was granted, and the rights claimed thrown into the form of a
statute, securing the privilege of the peerage, the immunity of the
clergy from the exactions of temporal officials, and ordering that at
the beginning of each Parliament the great officers should temporarily
resign their offices, to give time for an examination of their
conduct. In October, the King having secured his grants, thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
fit to revoke the statute, and was not ashamed to avow that he had
“wilfully dissembled as he ought” to avoid the dangers which
threatened him. The statute was cancelled in 1343, but the
privileges then granted were not questioned.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Loss of all
his allies.
1342.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">New opening
in Brittany.</div>
</div>

<p>As arranged, the truce with France continued till midsummer
1342. During that time Edward found that his German
allies had completely left him, and that even Louis of
Bavaria had been won over to Philip. This change in the
Emperor’s policy was caused by a wish to obtain Philip’s mediation
with his enemy the Pope. He excused it by urging that the treaty of
Esplechin had been made without his consent. Thus left without
allies, and impoverished by his late subsidies, which indeed, in the
absence of money, he had in some instances been obliged to pay in
raw wool, Edward might have been content to leave
France alone, had he not obtained a new footing in
Brittany. The war there was again a war of succession. John III.
of Brittany had three brothers, Guy, Peter, and John Earl of Montfort.
Guy and Peter died before their brother the Duke. Guy had
a daughter, Jane, who as heir of the duchy had married Charles of
Blois, the French King’s nephew. But upon the death of John, his
sole surviving brother, John Earl of Montfort claimed the duchy,
and did homage to Edward as King of France. The Peers of France
adjudged the duchy to Charles of Blois, and the two kings armed in
favour of their respective allies. Charles was at first successful, and
took John of Montfort prisoner. The war was, however, carried on
with enthusiasm by his wife, Jane of Flanders. She had the good
wishes of the people, and held out during the winter in the fortress
of Hennebone. She was almost reduced by famine, when the arrival
of Sir Walter Manny, who was followed later in the year by Edward
himself, raised the siege. But the country now became the battleground
between England and France. Edward on the one hand, and
the French King’s eldest son on the other, entered the duchy, but so
little was effected, that at the end of the year a truce for three years
and eight months was entered into, the matters at issue being referred
to the Pope.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Pope’s
position
as Arbiter
of Europe.</div>

<p>It is somewhat surprising to see how constantly the judgment of
the Papal See is appealed to, even more frequently than
in earlier times, when its authority was of greater weight.
No doubt the spiritual position of the Popes had constantly
been used as a means of interference in secular questions, and
by mere force of encroachment the Pontiff had come to be regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
as the natural arbiter of Europe. But behind this there lay a more
real ground for the exercise of the Papal authority. The Papal Curia
had in fact inherited a certain portion of the powers and duties of
the Roman Empire. During the vigour of Imperial institutions difficulties
arising between various states included within the limits of the
Empire were settled by the Emperor, who thus became the guardian of
international law. When the Empire lost its universal character, and
the German Kaiser (whatever vague notions of universal power may
have hung about his title) became practically the sovereign only of a
part of Europe, he lost the power of enforcing his decisions in the
case of quarrels between Princes, who were in fact his equals.
National quarrels must therefore have been settled by the sword
alone, had not the Court of Rome, still claiming universality,
still supplying trained lawyers and adequate courts, afforded an
opportunity for continuing in some degree the system of international
arbitration. The natural inclination of a spiritual power towards
peace rendered still more easy this transfer to the Papacy of the
guardianship of the international relations of Europe. The thirteenth
century had been remarkable for its systematizing character. Powers,
acknowledged by common practice and consent but not reduced to
system, began to be defined; and as Edward I. in England and
Philip IV. in France had brought into fixed and legal shape the lax
constitutions of their several kingdoms, so Boniface VIII. had
attempted to render Rome a formal court of appeal in all questions
of international law. It was thus that we find Wallace and the
guardians of Scotland appealing to Rome in their quarrel, and the
Pope asserting his supremacy over the Scotch kingdom at the close of
the reign of Edward I., and thus that we constantly find the Kings of
Europe appealing to the decision of the Papal Curia.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Mediation fails.</div>
</div>

<p>But although the Papal See thus comes constantly forward
as mediator in the quarrels of princes, and though cardinals were
repeatedly charged with missions of peace in all directions,
since the French had caused the overthrow of
Boniface VIII. it had no longer its old influence or its
old character. Seated at Avignon, the Pope was completely in the
hands of the French King; while the rising spirit of freedom, the
abuse of crusades which had been frequently employed
against Christian princes, and the infinite exactions
invented by the papal lawyers, had roused the temper of the people
against him. The English Parliament, therefore, was doing a less
difficult thing than the Parliament of Lincoln in Edward I.’s reign,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
when it insisted that the mediation specified in the treaty should be
regarded only as that of a private man, without special
authority or sanctity, and coupled even that modified
acceptance of the offer with a strong protest against provisors.
Having thus protested against the Pope, not without covert
allusion to the King’s own connection with him, the people made
grants, which were terribly wanted to save the King from his impoverished
condition. The great Italian house of the
Bardi was ruined by the great advances it made to him;
the German merchants of the Steelyard, the only corporation
of German merchants in London, had got a grant of much of the
taxes; the subsidies, as we have seen, had been paid in raw wool,
seized at the rate of £6 the sack, and sold at £20; the main point of
Bishop Stratford’s defence had been that the enormous interest on
the royal loans swallowed up at once all the money that was collected.
But for the timely and liberal grants of the people the government
must apparently have stopped. Meanwhile, the Pope was preparing
his decision; but it was impossible to expect an honest
verdict from him, and though, by the treaty, Philip
should have restored his prisoners, he still kept De Montfort and
others in prison.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Marches towards

</div>

<p>It was plain that the war would soon be renewed. The Parliament
in the year 1344 made their grants on the express understanding that
this was the case, and that Scotland was waiting to join in the quarrel.
In 1345 the expected event took place. The close connection between
England and Artevelt has been mentioned. It was of the last importance
to the Flemings that England should help them against their
Count, and supply their looms with wool. Artevelt now offered to
make the Prince of Wales Count of Flanders; and in all
probability the attack upon France would have been in
the old direction, had not a quarrel between the weavers
and the fullers in the Flemish towns produced the murder of their great
leader. It was in Gascony that the war actually broke out. Thither
the Earl of Derby,<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> the son of Henry of Lancaster, had been sent, and
he had there won a great victory over the French at Auberoche. He
was soon, however, hard pressed by Philip’s eldest son, the Duke of
Normandy, and driven to stand a siege in the fortress of
Aiguillon, on the Garonne. Meanwhile, a great fleet and
army had been collected, apparently for the purpose of
relieving them. But while sailing down the Channel Edward suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
changed his course, it is believed on the advice of Geoffrey of
Harcourt, a French refugee, and landed at La Hogue in
Normandy. His object was to draw the Duke of Normandy
northward, and thus to relieve Derby, while he
himself marched through France into Flanders, and joined his
Flemish allies, who had already crossed the French frontiers. But in
executing this manœuvre, Edward found all the bridges over the
Seine broken, and the French King in force upon the other side,
evidently desirous of hemming him in between his own army and
that of his son advancing from the south. It was in vain that
Edward pushed even to the suburbs of Paris, Philip
would not be provoked to break his plan of the campaign.
It became absolutely necessary for Edward to cross the river.
A rapid feint upon Paris left the broken bridge of Poissy open.
Edward hurried back, mended the bridge, and the river was passed.</p>

<p>The tables were now turned. It was the French King who wanted,
Edward who avoided, battle. He pushed on, destroying the country
as he went, till a fresh obstacle met him at the Somme. With Philip
and his vastly superior army immediately in his rear, his position
became critical. A peasant was induced to show him the ford of
Blanchetaque, near Abbeville, where the river could be crossed.
Even that ford was strongly defended, and only won after a sharp
skirmish in the midst of the water. The returning tide checked the
pursuit of the French, and enabled Edward, who had at length
determined to bring matters to a decisive issue, to choose his ground
in the neighbourhood of Cressy.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> There was fought the first of that
great series of battles, in which the small armies of the English
showed themselves superior to overwhelming numbers of French.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Change in the
character of the
army.</div>

<p>The cause of this superiority lay partly in the skill of the English
archers, but still more in the practised discipline of
regular volunteer soldiers, when opposed to an army
still formed upon the feudal model. The wars with
the Scotch had taught the English a lesson they had not been
slow to learn. Edward I. had been a soldier of the old school;
the strength of his armies had always consisted in the heavy armed
cavalry, in which man and horse had been laden with defensive
armour to the utmost limits of their capacity; the infantry had been
entirely a secondary consideration. But Wallace had proved at
Cambuskenneth, and (even though defeated) at Falkirk, the power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a><br /><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
resistance which resides in firmly arranged bodies of infantry. Bruce
at Bannockburn had shown still more plainly the weakness of heavy
cavalry upon ground not exactly suited for their particular form of
fighting. Edward III.’s chief claim to greatness as a soldier rests on
the readiness and skill with which he adopted the idea supplied him
by Bruce and Wallace. The difficulties of keeping together a feudal
array during a lengthened foreign campaign, the comparative cheapness
of an equipment of foot-soldiers, the increasing number of freemen
not employed upon the soil, were all likewise inducements to
change the character of the army. The cavalry employed in the
French wars was insignificant in comparison to the infantry. The
midland counties supplied the army with archers, Wales with
ordinary infantry. This change in the army, itself in part the fruit
of social growth, reacted on society. Regular hired troops required
trained commanders; and there thus grew up a class of professional
soldiers, whose existence dealt a heavy blow to the hitherto unquestioned
superiority of the feudal leaders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Cressy.
Aug. 26.</div>

<p>The hired army of the English, and the professional soldiers
who commanded them, formed a far more efficient body of
troops than was supplied by the feudal levies and noble
leaders of the French. The English were arranged in three divisions,
the foremost of which was nominally commanded by the Prince of
Wales. From the summit of the hill, Edward had a general survey
of the field. As usual, the archers began the battle; their flights of
arrows threw the Genoese crossbow-men, to whom they were opposed,
into confusion. The confusion once begun, the very numbers of the
French did but add to it. The Duke of Alençon, and the Count of
Flanders, with their followers, cut their way through their own
troops before they could reach the English men-at-arms. While these
successfully held their ground, the remaining masses of the French
were decimated by the English arrows, nor could any sufficient
support be given to Alençon. At length, as night closed in, Philip
left the field, and the further disconnected efforts of individual French
commanders were useless. The English could hardly believe their
good fortune, and Edward, fearing a return of their enemies, kept
them under arms during the night. The loss of the French was
enormous; the heralds appointed to examine the field reported the
death of eleven princes, 1200 knights, and 30,000 of inferior rank.
The English had killed considerably more than their own numbers;
but their little army was quite insufficient to advance into France, and
Edward, following his original plan, marched on to the siege of Calais.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of
Neville’s Cross.
Oct. 17.</div>

<p>The battle was on the 26th of August. Already some days before,
Lionel of Clarence, who had been left in command of England,
had summoned troops for the defence of the Scotch border; and Philip
now wrote strongly to David, begging him to make a diversion.
David was not sorry to answer to the call. Cumberland was
overrun, and the Bishopric of Durham; but the English levies,
inspirited by the courageous language of the Queen, and
under the joint command of the Percies and Nevilles,
defeated him completely at Neville’s Cross, David himself
being taken prisoner. The battle of Cressy had relieved the
Earl of Derby, who was again overrunning the south-west of France.
The year closed in triumph for the English arms in all directions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Siege of Calais.
1347.</div>

<p>This year of success was shortly crowned by the fall of Calais.
Edward had attacked that city by way of blockade,
shutting his army round it, and guarding the approaches
by the sea with his ships. All the efforts of the French King to relieve
it had been useless, and the slow process of famine at length obliged
its defenders to surrender. The inhabitants had not been free from
the usual crime of seafaring life at that time&mdash;they were the rivals in
piracy of the Cinque Ports and St. Malo. They had but little
mercy to expect from the King. Eustace de St. Pierre, an important
citizen, offered to give himself up, with a certain number of friends,
to bear the first brunt of the King’s anger, hoping thereby to save his
fellow-citizens. Barefooted and bareheaded, with ropes round their
necks, Eustace, with his devoted friends, appeared before the King.
Irritated with the long defence of the town, and their former
misdeeds, Edward would hear of no mercy; it was only at the
urgent prayer of Queen Philippa that the lives of the deputation
were spared. The advantages of the possession of Calais were
obvious. It afforded an excellent entrance into France in the
immediate neighbourhood of the King’s Flemish allies, and supplied
him also with a good central mart for the national commerce, which
in the existing state of trade was a thing much desired. The inhabitants
were therefore given their choice of being French or
English; those who refused to become English were expelled, and
their places occupied by English colonists, and the whole “staple”<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
trade of England was for a certain number of years confined to this
town, which accordingly became prosperous.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Truce.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">The Black Death.
1349.</div>
</div>

<p>It is somewhat strange to observe the smallness of the effect of the
late great victories. Edward seemed no nearer his objects than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
before he had won them. The exhaustion of his own kingdom
was almost equal to that of France, and shortly after the fall of
Calais, a truce was made for a few months, and afterwards
from time to time extended. One cause, no doubt,
of the general quietness which prevailed at this time in Europe was
the presence of the Black Death, a terrible scourge,
which, after passing over Europe, reached England in
1349. Its ravages were fearful. It is calculated that at least a
third, if not a half, of the whole population of England was swept
away. Such calculations are based partly upon the mortality among
the clergy: more than one half of the priests in Yorkshire died,
more than two-thirds of the beneficed clergy of Norfolk. In Norwich
alone 60,000 people are said to have perished. So fearful a plague
unavoidably changed the whole relation between employer and
employed, and while famine was threatening the country, while
farms could no longer be worked or harvests gathered for want of
hands, there was a natural disinclination to continue the war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Renewal of
the war.
1355.</div>

<p>It was not, therefore, till the year 1355 that the war was renewed.
Meanwhile, Philip of Valois had died, and been succeeded by his
son John, and at the instigation of the Pope, following his usual
pacific course, in 1354, a treaty had been set on foot. Edward, regarding
his claim to the French throne as hopeless, was willing to
accept a peace, if the French King would give him the province of
Aquitaine in full sovereignty. English plenipotentiaries appeared
at Guisnes ready to conclude the treaty, but the
French envoys then declared that they would never
surrender a fragment of the French sovereignty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Destructive
march of the
Black Prince.
1355.</div>

<p>Edward had no choice, therefore, but to renew the war. He
now possessed two points whence an attack on France was easy;
while he pushed out from Calais, the Black Prince was to lead an
army from Bordeaux. As so often happened upon the northern
frontier, the operations were without fruit; and the King was hastily
recalled to England by the news that the Scots had surprised Berwick,
and were over the Borders. The Black Prince’s expedition
was more successful. He marched at the foot of
the Pyrenees, and all through Languedoc to Narbonne,
and to Carcassonne, plundering and burning in all directions, destroying
in seven weeks more than five hundred towns or villages. Such
brutal and destructive war had indeed become habitual to the English.</p>

</div>

<p>The King’s return checked the advance of the Scots. Purchasing
the property and rights of Edward Balliol, he advanced into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a><br /><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
country, determined to treat it as a land of rebels. He systematically
destroyed every building, and laid waste the country for
twenty miles from the coast. But his severity was of no
avail; famine again drove him home, and the Scots again hung upon
his retreating forces. The following year the Black Prince attempted
a repetition of his last exploit. But he now pressed northwards, and
had reached the neighbourhood of Poitiers, when the
news that a large French army was near forced upon
him the danger of his situation, thus wholly separated
from his base of operations. The army which threatened him was
commanded by King John in person, and all the French princes
were with him. So irresistible did it seem, that Edward would have
listened to any good terms, but John would hear of nothing but unconditional
surrender, and the English, remembering their success at
Cressy, determined to fight. Again, what was regarded as their
extraordinary good fortune, but which was no doubt their superior
organization, secured them complete victory. On a
piece of ground difficult of access, except by a narrow
road exposed to the fire of the archers, and covered by enclosed
country, the hedges of which were lined by the same class of troops,
he awaited the assault of the French. The consequences can be
easily conceived. The heavy armed Frenchmen in the road formed a
target for the arrows; the confined space encumbered with wounded
men and horses made the confusion irremediable. The first body of the
French being thus disposed of, the Black Prince with his men-at-arms
attacked the second, while the third, alarmed by a flank attack
of six hundred English horse whom the Prince had detached for that
purpose, left the field. Between the Prince and the second body of
the French the conflict was a fierce one. It eventually terminated in
the complete victory of the English, and the capture of King John.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Peace with

</div>

<p>This victory was followed by a truce for two years, and Edward
had time to attend more particularly to the state of his affairs with
regard to Scotland. King David had been a prisoner, honourably
treated, in England since his capture at the battle of Neville’s Cross.
More than once the national party in his country had attempted
to come to terms for his release. His character, however, was not
such as to induce them to be eager on the matter; and he himself
seems to have preferred the comfort of England to the position of
King among his unruly subjects. He had been so obsequious, that he
had twice during these ten years visited Scotland as Edward’s agent,
for the purpose of obtaining, if possible, the submission of those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
were contending for his throne. But the Stewart, who was the head
of the national party, refused the recognition of English supremacy,
and no terms could be arrived at. In 1354 Edward thought he had
gained the success of his plan. David was to be released
for 90,000 marks. As we have seen, the intervention of
the French, followed by the fearful vengeance of Edward in that
expedition which is known as the Burnt Candlemas, put an end to
this treaty. Now, when all hope of help from France was gone, they
renewed their negotiation, and David was at length released upon
the promise of 100,000 marks, in ten yearly payments, a promise confirmed
by the delivery of important hostages. Edward
knew that he was really releasing a willing subject, and
that it was probable that the failure of payment, or the party
quarrels of the country, would before long put the kingdom into his
hands.</p>

</div>

<p>He was, at all events, free to act against France. On the capture
of its King, that country had fallen into the wildest
disorder. The Free Companies, as the hired bodies of
soldiery were called, from which both armies had been recruited,
freed from their engagements, pillaged the helpless country. In their
misery the lower commonalty broke out in fierce insurrections. The
people of Paris, under the Provost of the Merchants, Stephen
Marcel, enacted those scenes of revolution with which that city has
been too often familiar. Wearing the red cap of liberty, the mob
burst into the palace, killed two of the Dauphin’s most trusted
counsellors before his eyes, and drove that Prince to Compiègne.
Charles of Navarre, grandson of Louis X., who was surnamed the
Bad, broke from the prison in which he had been confined, made
common cause with the Parisian mob, roused his tenants in Normandy,
where he had much property, to insurrection, and called in
the English King. What with the Jacquerie,<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> the fierce plunderings
of the soldiery, the attacks of England, and the riot in Paris, the
condition of France was in the last degree terrible. However, the
murder of Stephen Marcel in Paris, and the success of
the Dauphin in compelling Charles the Bad to enter into
treaty with him, somewhat changed the aspect of affairs.
Nor would the Dauphin consent to yield any part of France to his
English conquerors.</p>

</div>

<p>Thus the time of truce wore away in useless negotiations. As it
ended, Edward renewed his invasions. Sir Walter Manny poured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
with an army of German hirelings over Picardy and Artois. Edward,
accompanied by all his sons except Thomas, whom he
left at home as ruler, pushed into the heart of Champagne,
tried in vain to take Rheims, where he hoped to be crowned,
and purchased the neutrality of the Duke of Burgundy. <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'But, succesful'">But, successful</ins>
and destructive as these invasions were, they were only vast
plundering excursions; there was little systematic action, no gradual
conquest of the country, no firm basis of operations. The very
destruction which they caused roused the national spirit, and while
Edward pushed to Paris, and tried in vain to excite the Dauphin to
a general engagement, the Norman fleet was ravaging England in the
neighbourhood of Winchelsea. Moreover, the wasted country could
not support the invading armies unassisted by a proper commissariat,
and as Edward, retiring from before Paris, was met
by a fearful tempest, which seems to have forced upon
him the difficulties of his position, he expressed himself
ready to listen to the terms of peace which the envoys
of the Legate and the Dauphin offered him. Thus, on
the 8th of May, the great peace of Brétigny was made. The terms
were, of course, very favourable to the English. Not only Gascony and
Guienne, but all Poitou, with the counties of Xaintonge, Agen,
Périgord, Limoges, Cahors, Rovergue, Bigorre, and in the north,
Montreuil, Ponthieu, with Calais and Guisnes, were to be the possessions
of the English crown, freed from all feudal claims. In return,
all claim to the crown of France was given up, together with all
claims in Normandy, Touraine, Anjou, Maine, Brittany, and Flanders.
King John was to be liberated on the payment of 3,000,000
pieces of gold.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Scotland and Flanders were to be left to themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Treaty not

<p>Edward thus appeared, even though he had not made good his
claims to the crown, to have regained and put on a better footing the
much disputed provinces of the south-west. But it was one thing to
make such a treaty and another to secure its being carried out. The
very misery of France produced a reaction. Though King John
himself returned to France to collect it, his enormous ransom was not
forthcoming. The barons of Poitou declared that they would not be
severed from the French crown; while the hatred to the English was
kept alive by the great bands of discharged soldiers, who, joining
themselves to the great Free Companies, swept across France, put the
Pope himself to ransom, and finding no congenial employment elsewhere,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
quartered themselves on the people. At the head of the party
who were set against the completion of the treaty was
Charles the Dauphin. His accession upon the death of
John, who had honourably returned to England when
he found himself unable to pay his ransom, marked a change in the
national policy of France. Under the new King, it was managed
that the renunciations required by the treaty should not be carried
out. There were other causes also at work which promised a speedy
renewal of the war.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Battle of

</div>

<p>By the treaty it had been expressly stipulated that the quarrel
between De Montfort and Charles de Blois might be continued,
though it was added, that whichever party conquered was bound to
swear fealty to France. Du Guesclin, a soldier of a
different class from the ordinary feudal leaders who had
risen to eminence during the late wars, was sent to support the
claims of Charles. The news of his arrival was at once followed by a
similar step on the part of the English. Chandos, an English general,
marched from Guienne to support De Montfort. A battle was fought
at Auray, in which De Montfort’s party were successful, and
Charles de Blois killed. The Free Companies too, of which the best
known are those of Calverley and Knowles, still ravaged France, and
were a constant cause of complaint. The English themselves had to
take part against them, but at length the means taken by King
Charles to rid his kingdom of this burden again brought the French
and English into contact. The provinces of the south-west of France
had been erected into the independent duchy of Aquitaine, and given
to the Black Prince, who held his court at Bordeaux. Thither,
when driven from his country, Pedro the Cruel, of Castile, betook himself.
This king had secured his throne by a series of
murders. His natural brother, Henry of Trastamare,
had fled and taken refuge with the French King. When Pedro carried
his cruelty to the pitch of putting to death his wife, Blanche de
Bourbon, a French princess, the court of France had determined to
assist Henry to dethrone his brother, and had intrusted Du Guesclin
with the duty of enlisting the Free Companies for this purpose. His
attempt had been successful; Pedro had taken flight, Henry had
ascended the throne. But Pedro, as a fugitive king, found ready
support at the hands of the Black Prince, thoroughly imbued with
the false chivalry of the day. It was whispered to the
Free Companies that their loved commander had an expedition
on foot. In numbers they deserted from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
French army, and gathered round the Black Prince, who was thus
enabled to cross the Pyrenees at Roncesvalles at the head of 30,000
men. The rival armies met at Navarette. The French
were completely beaten, Du Guesclin taken prisoner.</p>

<p>But Pedro, again upon the throne, forgot his engagements to his
protector, and the Black Prince returned to his duchy, broken
in health by the hardships of the campaign, and ruined by
its expenses. It became necessary to lay heavy taxes upon his
subjects. Those subjects were already discontented; the barons
of Poitou objected to the English supremacy, and had applied to
Charles as their suzerain. Charles had been fomenting their discontent,
and had sent secret envoys to raise a similar feeling
among the barons of Ponthieu in the north. To these
malcontents were now added the Counts of Armagnac, and other
barons of the northern slope of the Pyrenees, who regarded the infliction
of the tax as a breach of their privileges; and after keeping the
matter in abeyance for a year, till he was ready to strike, King
Charles, taking advantage of the non-completion of the
renunciations, proceeded to treat the Black Prince as a
vassal, and summoned him before his court. The Prince
answered he would appear at the head of 60,000 men-at-arms. The
threat was idle. Before, in his distressed position, he could make
any vigorous preparation, the French troops had begun to conquer the
outlying parts of his province, and a declaration of war was at once
issued. But several years of peace, during which the
exhausted country had begun to recover itself, had disinclined
the English to renew the war. The King appears to have
grown old before his time, and to have thought only of enjoying in
pleasure the fruits of his successful youth. Preparations went on but
slowly, while insurrections among the nobles, and the pressure of the
French army, continually increased around Guienne. There the
Black Prince was so ill that he could not himself take the field.
His brother Edmund of Cambridge, Chandos and Knowles, were
indeed with him, but could scarcely make head against
the insurgents. An attack upon Poitou failed, and
Chandos lost his life. None of the English plans met with success.
Knowles indeed, placed in command of Calais, marched again
successfully to Paris, but the long wars had given birth to a new race
of French generals, and Du Guesclin, now Constable, prevented any
great success. At length the Black Prince roused himself, and took
the field. At his mere name the French armies began to dissolve, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
he advanced triumphantly to Limoges, a town he had much favoured,
and on which he intended to wreak his vengeance.
The wall was mined, and the town taken. Men, women,
and children, to the number of 3000, were pitilessly murdered. In
the midst of this cruel slaughter, the Prince could show his knighthood
by sparing and honouring some French gentlemen
who made an unusually gallant resistance. It was his
last triumph. Early in 1371 he returned to England, broken and
dying. There is no need to trace the progress of the war further.
The gradual advance of the French could not be checked. The
English armies might march far into the country, as
one under Lancaster did in 1373, but the French invariably
avoided a general action; and thus, by 1374,
England had lost all her possessions in France, with the exception
of Calais, Bordeaux and Bayonne, and a few towns upon the
Dordogne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Naval victory of
the Spaniards.
1372.</div>

<p>The sequel of the Black Prince’s friendship for Pedro of Castile
deserves to be noticed. Upon the withdrawal of the English, Henry
of Trastamare again conquered Pedro, and the brothers having met in
Henry’s tent, a quarrel ensued, terminating in a personal struggle and
the death of Pedro. Henry thus regained the throne; and subsequently
two daughters of Pedro married two of Edward’s sons,
Lancaster and Cambridge. Upon the Duke of Lancaster’s assuming
the title of King of Castile, Henry entered actively
into the war, and at a great naval battle off Rochelle
in June 1372, completely destroyed the English fleet
under the Earl of Pembroke. At length a truce was agreed on,
which, though it never ripened into a peace, continued from time to
time during the rest of the reign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Discontent in
England.</div>

<p>A strange change of fortune thus clouded the end of what
promised to be a glorious reign. Edward, making war in the spirit of
a knight-errant, and trusting completely to the courage of his troops
on the day of battle, had neglected all the precautions which the
conquest of a country requires. He had been successful neither as a
strategist nor as a statesman, and his war with France, adorned with
splendid victories, and for one moment promising to establish on a
firm footing the English power in the South of France, had ended in
a more complete overthrow of that power than had been seen since
the time of King John. It was natural that the close of such a
reign should be marked by some expressions of discontent
among the people. Old before his time, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
hands of a woman of the name of Alice Perrers, whose ostentation
was constantly shocking the public eye, Edward had fallen under the
influence of bad advisers, and had let the reins of government slip
into the hands of John of Gaunt, his third son.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Politics of
the time.</div>

<p>To understand the politics of this time, we have to rid ourselves of
both the names and ideas of the present day. The lines
which divided classes were much more distinctly marked.
Political life was confined entirely to the upper ranks. The House
of Commons, which we are in the habit of regarding as a popular
assembly, and which was, in fact, the most popular assembly of that
time, was in part entirely aristocratic, in part representative of the
moneyed interests of the country. Below this no class could make
its voice heard at all, and this moneyed and aristocratic House of
Commons was only beginning by slow degrees to force itself into
political power. It had, in fact, consisted at first of two separate
orders,&mdash;the knights of the shire, who represented the lesser nobility,
and the burgesses. The knights had naturally joined without difficulty
in the deliberations of a baronage who were socially their equals;
the burgesses had busied themselves almost exclusively with financial
questions touching their own order. Various causes had gradually
tended to draw the two lower orders together, and by the beginning
of the reign of Edward III., the division of Parliament into two
Houses, of which the lower consisted of knights and burgesses, had
been completed. Indeed, the Act of 1321, passed when Edward II.
was victorious over the barons, had acknowledged the claims of the
burgesses to share in the proceedings of Parliament. The practical
government of the country had hitherto been in the hands of the
House of Lords. There were thus three distinct classes, the baronage,
the upper or represented commonalty, consisting of knights and burgesses,
and the lower commonalty. Power was as yet in the hands of
the baronage. When, therefore, no common cause was driving the
baronage to united action, as among all governing classes, there was
certain to be a difference of view, and the baronage would be
divided into parties. On the other hand, the upper Commons,
just forcing their way upwards, were inclined to be sometimes subservient
to the wishes of the Barons, sometimes ready to join that
one of the baronial parties which seemed to give them the greatest
promise of political assistance. The lower, or unrepresented Commons,
unable to make themselves heard, had been of no political
account; although a series of events had lately contributed to put
them in such a position that their friendship was worth having, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
to enable them soon to speak with arms in their hands, in a way
which was very terrible. Each of these classes had its own particular
interests, and made their combinations with the other classes to suit
the advance of those interests. The Barons desired power, the
higher Commons good administration, especially of the finances; the
lower Commons such improvements in their position as they afterwards
claimed under Wat Tyler. Hitherto, in the main, the interest
of the baronage had been the restriction within fixed limits of the
royal authority; they had hitherto been the guardians of the
constitutional growth of the country, and their rebellions and
opposition, whatever selfish leaven may have been mixed with them,
deserve to be regarded as efforts towards popular liberty. About
the period which we have now reached, this guardianship of the
Constitution passed into the hands of the upper Commons. The
Barons themselves having now acquired a preponderance in the
government, it was their encroachments rather than the King’s
which had to be guarded against. In principle, the safeguards of the
Constitution had been established by Edward I., and were therefore
no longer the subject of contention. The baronage was no longer
interested to secure power, but to enjoy a power already secured.
They thus fell into parties whose real object was to appropriate that
power. For that purpose, like other political parties, the rival
Barons would seek to attach to themselves any of the other sections
of society, and would therefore adopt those principles and those
party cries which seemed to promise them the most success. It
becomes, therefore, impossible to say that this or that baronial
insurrection was popular or constitutional. For their own objects,
the most disorderly Barons might attach themselves to the Commons,
to the lower classes, or to the King. Their divisions had, in fact,
become party struggles for power.</p>

<p>Now the chief questions at that time exciting England were the
position of the Church, the continuation of the war with France, and
the management of the finances. On any of these questions the
baronage might form itself into parties, which might seek their own
advantage by adopting the interests of other sections of society. It is
in this way that must be explained the apparent contradictions in the
conduct of the Parliament at the close of Edward’s reign. For many
years there had been growing a strong dislike to the Church in
England. The oppressions of the Popes, the selfish character of their
government at Avignon, the loss of spirituality on the part of the higher
clergy, from whose ranks the statesmen of the time were largely drawn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
and the deterioration of the mendicant orders, together with the idea
always prevalent in England of the supremacy of the state, had given
birth to a party who desired the pre-eminence in all matters of the laity,&mdash;a
party which is of course connected with the doctrinal views at this
time brought forward by Wicliffe. The existence of this lay party is
clearly shown by the proceedings of the year 1340, when for the
first time a lay Chancellor, Sir Robert Bouchier, was appointed in
the place of Stratford. When the baronage were divided, the natural
leaders of the parties were the royal princes. Thus, when circumstances
had put the reins of power into the hands of John of Gaunt,
he fortified himself by assuming the leadership of the lay party,
which found its adherents in all sections of society, but no doubt
mainly among the barons, jealous of the great part played in
the government by the clergy, the vast wealth which the Church
held, and which is calculated at more than a third of the land, and
rendered self-confident by their successes in the French war. Already
schemes for the confiscation of Church property had been publicly
mentioned, and the Commons, with the approbation of John of Gaunt,
had in 1371 petitioned for the removal of all the clergy from the higher
offices of state. The Bishop of Winchester, William of Wykeham, had
surrendered the great seal, which, together with the offices of the
exchequer, had been put into the hands of laymen. There are many
proofs that the class which was represented in the Commons partook
strongly of the dislike to the Church. But any claim to popularity
which Lancaster’s administration might have advanced on this ground
was destroyed by their mismanagement of the finances and the disasters
of the foreign war. In fact, there is little doubt that the ecclesiastics
he had displaced were far better governors than the partisans he had
put in their places. Another party was therefore formed, at the head of
which was the Black Prince, a party consisting of those who preferred
the old system of government, and which included the higher
clergy and the financial reformers. It has been pointed out that the
disastrous government of John of Gaunt had found its partisans
chiefly among the Barons. On the whole, therefore, the Commons
attached themselves to the party of the Black Prince. For the time
a restoration of good government and well-managed finance seemed
to them of more importance than the overthrow of the Church,
especially as their interests as a class seemed to lead in the same
direction. The struggle came to an issue in the Good Parliament,
which met in April 1376. The Commons presented a remonstrance,
which, after enumerating their financial grievances, and asserting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
the mismanagement of the Government, demanded a change in
the council; in other words, a change of ministry. The clergy,
and William of Wykeham among them, again came into office.
They were not content with this, but impeached&mdash;and this is
the first instance of parliamentary impeachment&mdash;Lord Latimer,
the Chamberlain. A considerable number of the other officers
were arrested and thrown into prison, and Alice Perrers was forbidden
to use her influence under pain of banishment. They were
still discussing further reforms, when the death of the Black Prince
deprived them of their chief support. Afraid that John of Gaunt
had views on the succession, they insisted on the immediate recognition
of the Black Prince’s son; and a deputation waited on the old
King at Eltham to receive an answer to their complaints and petitions.
These, as might be expected, were chiefly directed against the
encroachments of the Papacy, in hatred to which all parties in
England joined. Still the King’s reply shows the influence of the
newly restored clerical counsellors. Enough, he said, had been done
in the way of legislation, he would continue his personal appeals to
the Pope. Parliament then separated.</p>

<p>It at once became plain that the Black Prince’s death had again
thrown the power into the hands of John of Gaunt.
The power of the new Privy Council disappeared, Lord
Latimer was pardoned, Peter de la Mare, the speaker of
the Good Parliament, was thrown into prison, William of Wykeham
was again driven from the court. The Parliament
which assembled next year was thoroughly in the Lancastrian
interest. Sir Thomas Hungerford, the Duke’s
steward, was elected Speaker, the proceedings against Alice Perrers
withdrawn, and a new form of tax&mdash;a poll-tax of 4d.&mdash;granted. But
the clergy did not thus easily yield their ground. They attacked
the apostle of the lay party, Wicliffe. He had to appear
before Courtenay, Bishop of London, in St. Paul’s. He
came, supported by Lancaster and by the Marshall, Henry Percy,
a close adherent of that party of which Lancaster was the head.
An unseemly brawl arose in the church. Lancaster threatened to
drag Courtenay out of the church by the hair. The Londoners were
already so ill disposed to Lancaster, that measures were in preparation
to remove their mayor, and put the government of the town in the
hands of a royal commission. The insult to their Bishop
roused them to fury. It was only by Courtenay’s intervention
that Lancaster’s house was saved from demolition; and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
wretched man was killed under the supposition that he was Henry
Percy. Lancaster escaped, and the city had to make some sort of reparation;
but the quarrel was scarcely quieted when the
King died. Deserted by his mistress, who is said to
have torn the rings from his dying hand, and by his servants, the
wretched old man died, tended only by a single poor priest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulties of
the new reign.<br /><br />
Regency.<br /><br />
Patriotic
government.</div>

<p class="drop-cap">The young King was but a child, and there was a prospect of a
long minority, affording an ample field for the intrigues of party.
The position of the kingdom too was such as to promise
a time of considerable difficulty. The war with France
had been put off by a succession of truces, but was still threatening,
and England was in no condition to meet it. An invasion actually
took place. French troops landed in the Isle of Wight, and laid
waste the country. Moreover, the last reign had closed amidst
domestic difficulties. The Lords therefore thought it right to take
the settlement of the kingdom into their own hands. At a great
council it was determined to form a Council of Regency, drawn from
all orders represented in Parliament, to assist the great
officers of the crown. The dangers which beset the
country induced all parties for a time to rally honestly round the
throne. The royal princes, who might become party leaders, were on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
that account excluded from the Council. The national party again
gained the majority in the Commons, and again elected
De la Mare as their Speaker. But the Commons had no
wish to drive matters to extremity, or to change the existing balance
of power. They fell back into their old position, which they had
temporarily felt themselves obliged to desert, declined to have anything
to do with matters of state; and when told to consider the best
means for the defence of the kingdom, they pleaded their inability to
answer, named a council of peers whom they thought qualified for
the purpose, and made overtures of friendship by placing Lancaster’s
name at the head of the list. Lancaster, who desired power and had
no fixed principles, accepted the position, first making a solemn
denial of all the calumnious reports which were afloat about him, and
thus again became practically Prime Minister. But the Commons
showed that they intended to keep their own great object, economical
management of the finances, steadfastly in view, by insisting that the
subsidy, which was granted at once upon this reconciliation, should
be paid into the hands of two treasurers named by themselves. They
also demanded, as a further guarantee of good government, that the
great officers of state and the judges should be chosen by the Lords,
and publicly named to the Commons. The King was left unrestrained
in the choice of those who should be about his person. At the next
Parliament, held at Gloucester in 1378, they still pursued the same
policy, and refused to grant a new subsidy till the accounts of that
last granted had been exhibited to them. It was plain that the
constant repetition of subsidies was much disliked.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Poll-tax.</div>
</div>

<p>But the continuation of war in Brittany soon made fresh demands
for money necessary. This war had closed by a sudden
revulsion of feeling on the part of the Bretons, who had
been roused to extreme anger by the annexation of
the province by the French King. But on his death they became
equally hostile to their late friends the English, and drove them from
the country. To supply this want of money, new methods of taxation
were devised. A poll-tax, graduated from £6, 13s. 4d. on the Duke
of Lancaster, to 4d. on the ordinary labourer and his
family, was granted, but produced not half the sum required.
Further demands were made, and the consent of the Commons
purchased by reforms of the household, and by the establishment
of a Parliamentary finance committee. Even the new grants thus
purchased did not suffice, and at the end of the year 1380, a poll tax
graduated from £1 to 1s. per head was imposed on every male and female.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Insurrection of
the Villeins.
1381.</div>

<p>The exaction of this tax, which fell proportionately with much
greater weight on the lower, unrepresented orders, produced the
great insurrection known as Wat Tyler’s insurrection.
Many causes had been at work, not in England
only, but throughout Europe, to excite discontent
among the labouring classes. The severity and rough inquisitorial
spirit with which the present impost was collected was beyond
what they could bear. In Essex, under Jack Straw, at Dartford,
under Wat Tyler, whose daughter had been subjected to insult,
and at Gravesend, where Sir Simon Burley had laid claim to
a labourer as his villein, insurrections broke out. Wat Tyler
was chosen for the general leader, accompanied by John Ball, the
popular itinerant preacher. But the insurrection was not confined
to these counties only, it extended from Winchester to Scarborough.
It was in all respects a revolutionary movement. Manor-houses
were pillaged and destroyed, and the court rolls, where the villeins’
names were written, were burnt. Officials, those who had served on
juries, justices, and even lawyers, were put to death. The rebels were
particularly embittered against John of Gaunt, swearing to admit no
king of the name of John, and refused all taxes except the customary
tenth and fifteenth.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Death of
Wat Tyler.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Insurrection
suppressed.</div>
</div>

<p>The insurgents entered Southwark, and pillaged the palace of Lambeth;
on the following day penetrated into London, freed the prisoners
in Newgate, destroyed Lancaster’s house of the Savoy, and showed their
national spirit by killing some fifty Flemish merchants. The King
was alone in London; he offered to meet them at Mile End. He
there received their petition, which demanded not political but social
rights,&mdash;the abolition of villeinage, the reduction of rent to fourpence
an acre, the free access to all fairs and markets, and a general pardon.
The King granted their demands; and charters were at once drawn
up for every township. But, in the meanwhile, the more advanced
leaders, disliking the moderation of the bulk of their followers, broke
into the Tower and ransacked it. On the following day, the King
came across these men in Smithfield. Tyler was at their head. He
advanced to have a personal interview with the King, and was
suddenly killed by Walworth, the Lord Mayor, as he played with his
dagger, an action which was construed as a threat. The
young King, with remarkable presence of mind, rode
forward to the astonished rebels, declared that he would be their
leader, and induced them to follow him to Islington, where they
found themselves in the presence of Sir Robert Knowles and 1000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
soldiers. They at once yielded, and demanded the King’s mercy;
he declined to punish them, and dismissed them to their homes.
When time had thus been gained, the crisis was over.
Richard found himself at the head of an army. Several
defeats and numerous executions broke the spirit of the rebels, and
the insurrection was suppressed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament
rejects the
villeins’ claims.</div>

<p>In autumn the Parliament met. The King declared he had recalled
his charters, but asked the Commons to consider the propriety
of abolishing villeinage. The ignorance and want of sympathy with
the feelings of the class below them, which existed among the representative
Commons, was then made evident. No men, they said,
should rob them of their villeins. The charters were
therefore finally revoked; and not only the charters,
but the general pardon also: at least 250 persons were
exempted from it. Meantime, the House of Commons made political
capital out of the insurrection; they declared that the cause of the insurrection
was not the social oppression of the labourer, but their own
grievances, purveyance, the rapacity of the officers of the Exchequer,
the maintainers, or bands of robbers who carried on depredations
in some counties, and the heavy taxation. This was followed by a
further inquiry into the royal household.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Lancaster’s
government.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">He deserts
Wicliffe.</div>
</div>

<p>Lancaster continued in power for three years longer. His ministry
was unmarked by success; and the feeling against him, which had
been exhibited in the insurrection, found frequent expression.
With regard to Church reform he had completely
changed his tactics. When Wicliffe passed beyond his attacks upon
the abuses of the Church, and touched its doctrine, questioning even
the fundamental point of Transubstantiation, Lancaster
withdrew his support. Although Wicliffe was so far
upheld by Parliament, that a statute which had been passed for the
suppression of his “poor priests” was repealed, he was unable, without
Lancaster’s assistance, to withstand the power of the Church, and
was compelled to make some form of recantation before he regained
his living of Lutterworth, where he died in 1384. But Lancaster
reaped no advantage from this change in his conduct. Every disaster
was still laid to his charge, and the old suspicion that he harboured
covert designs upon the throne still clung to him. The great schism
was at this time dividing the Catholic Church. For seventy years
the Papacy fixed at Avignon had been the servant of the French
king: the Babylonish captivity the Italians called it. Gregory
XI. restored the Papacy to Rome, but his death was followed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
a double election. The French cardinals elected Clement VII.,
the Roman cardinals Urban VI.; and the Christian world was
divided in its allegiance. In the interests of Pope Urban, who was
received in England, the Bishop of Norwich, a remarkable prelate,
who had distinguished himself in the suppression of the late insurrection,
was engaged to lead an army against France. He selected
the old road of attack. The Flemish citizens, in spite of the death of
their great leader, Philip Van Artevelt, and of a crushing defeat they
had received from the French chivalry at Rosbecque, continued their
enmity to France. The Bishop was to act in concert with them.</p>

</div>

<p>His expedition failed; it was currently reported that
Lancaster had thwarted it. A certain friar came to the
King offering to prove traitorous designs on the part of
Lancaster. Sir John Holland, the King’s half-brother, and a partisan
of Lancaster’s, into whose charge he was given, killed him. His death
was no doubt suspicious. His story against Lancaster was believed.
In 1385, Scotland, which had been subsidized by France, became
troublesome. Richard led an army against it; but the
advice of De la Pole, the King’s chancellor and favourite
minister, who pretended to dread the designs of Lancaster,
induced Richard to retreat, and the expedition came to nothing.
Moreover, still further to mark his fear of Lancaster, Richard declared
Roger, Earl of March, his presumptive heir. The enmity
between March and Lancaster, in which perhaps may be traced the
first beginnings of the Wars of the Roses, had been already marked in
the last reign. Peter de la Mare was the steward of the Earl of
March, while Sir Thomas Hungerford, the speaker of the following
Parliament, occupied the same office in the household of Lancaster.</p>

<p>John of Gaunt, thus mistrusted and opposed, was glad to

</div>

<p>He was at once succeeded in his influence and in his party
leadership by a far more dangerous man, another uncle
of the King, Thomas, Duke of Gloucester. Meanwhile
the politics of England had changed, and had fallen back
into their normal condition. We have seen that the King had
been allowed the free selection of his own household. He had
surrounded himself by men not drawn from the higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
baronage.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> His chief favourite was De Vere, whom he had made
Earl of Oxford, and subsequently Duke of Ireland,
and to whom he had intrusted the government of
that disturbed country; while his ministers nominated by Parliament
were also men who owed their position to their capacity
rather than to their birth. The chief of these was Michael de la
Pole, the chancellor, whom the King had raised to the rank of
Earl of Suffolk. He was thus open to the old charge of favouritism.
The Lancastrian party had set themselves against his favourites.
Already one of them, the Earl of Stafford, had been killed by Sir John
Holland, and Gloucester found no difficulty in forming a
powerful party among the barons, taking for his cry the
reform of the administration, and seeking to excite the
national feeling, by keeping alive the animosity against France, towards
which country Richard was much drawn; while the specious pretext of
reform as usual attracted the Commons. In 1386, Gloucester took advantage
of a threatened invasion from France to produce charges against
the administration. The King’s officers, it was said, had used the public
revenues for their own purposes; the Commons had been impoverished
by taxes, the landowners could not get their rents, and tenants
were compelled to abandon their farms through distress. The three
last of these charges were traceable, not to government, but to economical
changes, but served well as a party catchword; and so successful
were they, that in a Parliament held at Westminster, Commons
and Lords united in demanding a change of ministry.
After a contest of three weeks the King yielded. Suffolk
was dismissed, and his dismissal was immediately followed
by his impeachment. The charges brought against
him were held to be partly proved, and he was sentenced to be kept
in prison during the King’s pleasure. After the dissolution of Parliament
he was released. His place was taken by Arundel, Bishop of Ely.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Affair of

</div>

<p>This blow, though severe, was followed by a worse one. The old
baronial policy of establishing a committee of reform was renewed. To
intimidate the King, the statute of the deposition of Edward II. was
produced in Parliament. The estates having declared that unless he
granted their requests they would separate without his permission, he
was finally compelled to authorize a commission of
eleven peers and bishops, to inquire into abuses and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
regulate reform. Their duty was a very wide one, touching the
household, the treasury, and all complaints out of the reach of law.
The partisans of Gloucester formed the majority of this committee,
of which the Duke himself and his chief friend, Lord Arundel,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> were
members. It was arranged that the power of the committee should
last for one year only. It does not seem to have brought to light
any great abuses, nor was its government sufficiently superior to that
which had preceded it to justify its establishment. Richard had no
mind to submit to a limitation of his prerogative which seemed so
little called for. He set to work with his usual secretiveness. At
Shrewsbury, and again at Nottingham, he inquired
of the judges how far the late conduct of the reformers
was constitutional. Their reply was strongly in favour
of the prerogative. They declared the late measures treasonable, and
its authors liable to capital punishment, denied the power of Parliament
to impeach, and declared Suffolk’s condemnation false. Fulthorpe,
one of the King’s judges, though sworn to secrecy, at once told
Gloucester of the King’s questions. Consequently, when Richard
had made all preparations for a sudden <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’état</span>, he was alarmed
to find that Gloucester, Arundel, and Nottingham, had reached
London the same day as himself, with a numerous army.
At Waltham Cross the Earls of Derby and Warwick
joined them, and they proceeded to appeal, or, as we
should say, accuse of high treason, the Archbishop of
York, the Duke of Ireland, the Earl of Suffolk, Robert Tresilian the
judge, and Sir Nicholas Brember, whose influence had been employed
to secure London for Richard. The accused sought refuge in flight,
and the Duke of Ireland succeeded in raising troops in the West, and
attempted to bring the matter to the issue of battle.
But the Lords Appellant were beforehand with him;
he was unable to cross the Thames, as he hoped, at Radcot; and being
there surrounded, with difficulty escaped by swimming the river.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">The Wonderful
Parliament.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Gloucester’s
unimportant
government.</div>
</div>

<p>The appellants, now masters of the kingdom, made a thorough
clearance of all who could be considered King’s favourites. Eleven of
his intimate friends were imprisoned, a number of the lords and
ladies of the Court removed, and in February 1388, a Parliament
known as the “Wonderful or merciless Parliament”
assembled, which, in a long session of 122 days, was
employed almost entirely in destroying the enemies of Gloucester.
His appeal was heard, and all the five accused gentlemen were found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
guilty; three escaped, Tresilian and Brember were put to death.
Some of the judges were likewise executed, some pardoned on the intercession
of the bishops, and four knights, old and intimate friends
of Richard, of whom Sir Simon Burley is the best known, were also
impeached and beheaded. Parliament closed with an ordinance,
declaring that the treasons for which these men had suffered were not
established by any statute, and should not form a precedent; and by
exacting a repetition of Richard’s coronation oath. For a year,
Gloucester ruled at his will, without any marked success.
The Percies were defeated by the Scotch at Otterbourne,
and an invasion from France was only averted by the
incessant dissensions which had arisen in that country during the
minority of Charles VI. Before the end of Gloucester’s administration,
however, truces were concluded with both Scotland and France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Richard assumes
sole authority.
1389.</div>

<p>Richard appears to have been able to dissemble profoundly; he
had been most submissive to his conquerors, who believed their power
safe, when, at a council in the spring of 1389, he quietly asked
Gloucester how old he was. Gloucester replied that he was twenty-two.
“Then,” said the King, “I am certainly old enough to
manage my own affairs. I thank you, my lords, for your
past services; I want them no longer.” He then proceeded
to change the ministry, removed Arundel from the chancellorship,<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
and took the government into his own hands. Although the
ministry was changed, there was no great reversal of policy, no
punishment of the Lords Appellant. On the contrary, the King,
under the advice, it is probable, of William of Wykeham, seemed
determined to ignore party, and to attempt a moderate government.
He declared that he would be bound by the decisions of the late
Parliament, employed among his most intimate counsellors, Derby,
who had been one of the appellants, and the Duke of York, who had
been on the commission of 1386; and it would appear that he did not
even remove Gloucester from his councils. In pursuance of this
national and healing policy, in the following year, the chief officers
temporarily resigned their offices, that their administration might be
examined. The Commons found not the slightest cause of complaint,
and they were reinstated at once. This peaceable state of affairs
continued till 1397. During the whole of that time, we must
believe that Richard was only waiting his opportunity. There were
indeed some signs of his secret thoughts. Some of his banished
friends were relieved or obtained places in Ireland. On the death of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Robert de Vere he succeeded in obtaining the Earldom of Oxford for
his uncle, Aubrey de Vere; and a year or two afterwards he brought
his friend’s body, which had been embalmed, from abroad, and before
it was reburied, had the coffin opened, and gazed with much emotion
upon the dead man’s face. But outwardly such unity reigned, that
national matters could be considered, and the period is marked by the
completion of the quarrel with the Papacy with regard to Provisors,
and by an expedition to Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Final Statute of
Provisors.</div>

<p>England, it has been said, embraced the cause of Urban VI. In
his gratitude he had given the King the nomination to
the two next vacant prebends in all collegiate churches.
But the appointment by the Pope of an Abbot of St. Edmunds, in
1380, produced a repetition of the Statute of Provisors of Edward
III.’s reign.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Still the laws were repeatedly evaded, the Pope always
presenting to benefices which fell vacant at Rome. As the cardinals
generally died at Rome, this was a large exception. In 1390, the
29th of January of that year was settled as a term. All Provisors
before that year were legal; all after, together with the introduction
of any Papal letter of recommendation, absolutely illegal. In 1391,
the new Pope, Boniface IX., declared all these enactments void, and
proceeded to grant Provisors. Consequently, in 1393,<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> was drawn
up the final Statute of Provisors, or Præmunire. By this any man
procuring instruments of any kind from Rome, or publishing such
instruments, was outlawed, his property forfeited, and his person
apprehended.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Expedition to
Ireland.
1394.</div>

<p>The following year the King made an expedition to Ireland. The
condition of that country had long demanded attention.
Since the invasion of the Bruces, the native tribes had
made considerable advances on all sides, but their
domestic dissensions prevented any permanent success. A far greater
evil was the condition of the Irish of old English race. The
want of strong central authority had allowed the individual chieftains
to establish something like royal power in their own dominions;
they were gradually falling back into barbarism, and in a way very
unusual among conquering races, had been gradually adopting the
manners and laws of the conquered race around them. Among them,
as among the natives, perpetual discord and fighting existed. So
disorderly were they, that Edward III. had ordered that no official
places should be occupied except by men born in England; and
Lionel of Clarence, who had been appointed to bring the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
into order, had, in 1364, procured, at the Parliament of Kilkenny,
statutes, directed not against the Irish, but against the English
settlers, making the adoption of Irish habits, and of the Brehon
or Irish law, high treason. Earlier in the reign, Richard had
appointed his favourite De Vere to restore order. His success had
been prevented by the attack upon him by the Lords Appellant
in 1387. The King now, in the year 1394, determined to go in
person. His measures were just and moderate, and he succeeded in
inducing all the native princes to swear fealty.</p>

<p>He was called home by the excesses of the Lollards, as the
followers of Wicliffe were called. They had prepared a petition, containing
a forcible exposition of their own tenets, and a vigorous attack
on the priests. The Church demanded the presence and protection of
the King, who, on his arrival in England, expelled the Lollards from
Oxford. At the same time he contracted a marriage,
consonant with his known French views, with Isabella,
the daughter of Charles VI. of France, a Princess of ten
years of age. In 1397, the marriage ceremony having been performed,
the young Queen was crowned. It seems possible that it was in reliance
upon this new friendship with France that the King now determined
to execute his long dissembled vengeance. The seven years of peaceful
government had allayed suspicion, and won him popularity.
Lancaster, who had returned from Spain, had ceased to take a very
prominent part in the government, and had, moreover, been gratified
by the legitimization of his children by his mistress Catherine Swinford.
His son, the Earl of Derby, had deserted his former associates,
and was one of the King’s advisers. Mowbray of Nottingham,
another of the Lords Appellant, had also been won over. The Duke
of York had throughout been friendly disposed to the King. On the
other hand, Gloucester had been continually acting in a spirit of
covert hostility. He had made political capital by opposing the French
match, and by publicly speaking against the extravagances of the royal
household, which appear to have been very great. Froissart, indeed,
mentions a story, which however needs confirmation, that he had
combined with Warwick and the Arundels in a plot to seize the King.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Richard’s
vengeance after
seven years’
peace.</div>

<p>Richard carried out his plans of vengeance with his usual secrecy
and skill. Suddenly, Warwick, Arundel and Gloucester
were apprehended, and sent to different and distant
castles. He then proceeded against them as they had
themselves proceeded against his friends. They were appealed of
treason by a number of Earls in the royal interest. Rickhill, one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
justices, was sent to Calais to obtain Gloucester’s confession, and a
Parliament was assembled at Westminster, in which the good will of
the Commons had been already secured. As a preliminary measure,
all pardons to Gloucester, Arundel and Warwick were revoked. An
impeachment was then brought against the Archbishop Arundel, and
the appeal against the Duke and the two Earls was heard. Arundel
refused to plead anything but his pardon. This having already been
revoked, he was at once condemned and executed. The Earl
Marshall, to whom Gloucester had been intrusted, was ordered to produce
him, but replied that the Duke was dead. It seems almost certain
that he had been murdered by Richard’s orders at Calais. The
Archbishop was condemned to banishment for life; and Warwick,
who pleaded guilty, was exiled to the Isle of Man. Lord Mortimer,
who was also involved in the accusation, fled to Ireland, and was
outlawed. A shower of new titles was lavished on the obsequious
Lords. Derby and Rutland were made Dukes of Hereford and
Albemarle; Nottingham, Duke of Norfolk; De Spencer, Neville,
Percy and Scrope, respectively, Earls of Gloucester, Westmoreland,
Worcester and Wiltshire. A statute was passed making it treason to
levy war against the King, and declaring the penalty of treason
against any one who should attempt to overthrow the enactments of
this Parliament. The next Parliament at Gloucester, in 1398, acted in
the same obsequious manner. The Acts of the Wonderful Parliament
were repealed. To the grant of a subsidy was added the tax on
wool and hides for life; and a permanent committee of twelve peers and
six commoners was appointed to represent Parliament for the future.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hereford and
Norfolk
banished.</div>

<p>The new Dukes of Hereford and Norfolk alone remained unpunished
of the old Lords Appellant of 1386. These two men, who
had shared in the destruction of their former associates, had now
quarrelled, and Hereford brought a formal charge against
Norfolk of treasonable conversation. To the Parliamentary
committee this question was now referred, and
by them laid before a court of chivalry; at the same time the committee
enacted laws in the royal interest, exactly as though it had been the
Parliament. It was agreed that the dispute between the two dukes
should be settled by the arbitrament of battle. The lists were prepared
at Coventry, but as the combatants were about to engage, the King
took the matter into his own hands, and, on what principle it is impossible
to conceive, punished both; Hereford he banished for ten years,
Norfolk for life. Richard had thus destroyed his old enemies, rid
himself of the constraint of Parliament, and was practically despotic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
“Then the King began to rule,” says Froissart, “more fiercely than
before. In those days there were none so great in England that
durst speak against anything that the King did. He had council
meet for his appetite, who exhorted him to do what he list. He still
kept in his wages 10,000 archers. He then kept greater state than
ever, no former king had ever kept so much as he did by 100,000
nobles a year.”<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>He acted in accordance with his position. He raised forced loans,
meddled in the administration of justice, and went so far as to declare
no less than seventeen counties outlawed, for having, as
he asserted, favoured the Lords Appellant before the
affair at Radcot Bridge. But he overrated his real
power. His government had been accepted because it had been
constitutional and moderate. The change which was evident since
his acquirement of the sole authority induced the people to give the
credit of that moderation to Hereford, who had been a chief member
of that council, and who was a popular favourite. Thousands had
attended him as he left England for his banishment, and excitement
spread through the country when the King, in contravention of his
promise and of law, refused him the succession to his father’s title
and property upon the death of that prince. Regardless of the
discontented feeling of the people, Richard unwisely
determined upon another expedition to Ireland, to complete
his work there, and to exact vengeance for the
death of the Earl of March, whom he had named as his successor.
The kingdom was thus left vacant, and in the charge of the Duke of
York, whose subsequent conduct proved that he shared in the
national feeling.</p>

<p>The new Duke of Lancaster took advantage of this act of folly to
land at Ravenspur in Yorkshire, declaring loudly that he came but to
demand his family succession. The Percies, the old
friends of the Lancastrians, received him with gladness,
and his march southwards soon became formidable. The
King’s ministers, Wiltshire, Bussy, and Greene, fled for refuge to
Bristol. Thither York also betook himself, thus leaving the capital
open. Lancaster, now at the head of a powerful army, also drew to
the West. As he came within reach of the Duke of York, civilities
were exchanged, which proved that he had no opposition to fear from
him. Bristol opened its gates. The King’s favourites were seized
and executed, and the King, who had landed in Wales from Ireland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
with the Duke of Albemarle and other nobles, saw his army rapidly
dissolve, and had to take refuge in the castle of Conway.
Henry of Lancaster found himself joined by all the
nobility. He commissioned Percy of Northumberland to procure
a meeting with Richard at Flint. The proposed meeting was a trap
to catch the King; as he rode from the castle with Northumberland,
Richard found himself in the midst of hostile troops. When he was
introduced to the presence of Lancaster, he knew that his fate was
sealed, and with his peculiar power of accepting circumstances, was
entirely submissive in his behaviour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Makes him

kingdom.</div>

<p>A Parliament had been summoned to meet in September; but
before that time, Richard was induced to make a formal resignation
of the kingdom. Not content with this, when the Parliament met,
Henry caused the coronation oath to be read. It was contended that
Richard had broken it, and therefore forfeited the crown. The Bishop
of Carlisle alone raised his voice in favour of the fallen
King, and demanded that he should at least be heard in
his defence. His interference was, of course, in vain.
The deposition of the King was voted. The throne being thus vacant,
the Duke was not long in laying claim to it. In a curious document,
in which he mingled the claims of blood, of conquest, and the necessity
of reform, he put forward his demands. They were unanimously
admitted. The Archbishop of Canterbury took him by the hand and
led him to the throne. It was his cue to act with strict legality, yet
he could not afford to do without a Parliament so obviously devoted
to his interests. As that Parliament had expired by Richard’s
deposition, he immediately issued writs for a new one, returnable in
six days, thus rendering it absolutely impossible to make any new
elections. It was with the Parliament thus secured that he began his
reign.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Although the narration of political facts implies much of the
history of the country, it leaves out of sight much that
touches the real life of the people. During the last hundred years
great social changes had been going on, and great social progress
made. In fact, till the end of the reign of King John, the social,
like the political history of the country scarcely deserves the name
of national. The description of any feudal society will in a great
measure suit it. But the national existence had been worked out
in the reign of Henry III., and was completed and finally established
by the great time of Edward I. From that time onwards,
continuous change and growth had been visible, and that growth had
been national. The great fact of all modern history is the breaking
up of the feudal and ecclesiastical system of the middle ages, and the
introduction, as political and social elements of weight, of the middle
and industrial classes. It is the beginning of that process which constitutes
therefore the history of this period. The points to observe will
be, therefore, the growth and advance of the commons, the decay of
the aristocracy. But it is as yet quite impossible to speak of the
commons as one body. The line which divided the class which sent
its representatives to Parliament, and which was already becoming of
political importance, from the mass of the labouring part of the
nation, was very clearly drawn, and the characteristics, the employments,
and the feelings of the one class, as well as the causes of their
advance, will be very different from those of the other. A brief
sketch has been already given of the gradual introduction of the
commons into Parliament. But it still remains to explain and
illustrate the sources of their wealth, their aristocratic tendencies,
and the prevalence among them of a strong distaste for the pre-eminent
position occupied by the Church. It was their wealth which gained
them admission to Parliament, and the way in which that wealth
was gained which greatly influenced their views after they had been
admitted.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Trade.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">The staple.</div>
</div>

<p>Trade, on which their riches depended, was as yet in its infancy;
and the views which regulated its management as yet too
crude to be spoken of by such a dignified title as political
economy. As far as they went, however, they were very clear, and
were, in fact, though afterwards improved, the same in spirit as those
which existed in England before the time of Adam Smith. Observing
only the obvious fact, that the possession of money enabled a
man to purchase whatever he wanted, early traders conceived the
idea that money was wealth, and that nothing else was. And as the
wealth of the nation was of the last importance, both to the governor
and to the governed, and as trade was the chief method by which
money could be supplied, and by which money might be drawn from
the country, the regulation of trade became one of the most important
duties of the King and the Parliament. Now money being the sole
wealth, in that regulation of trade it became necessary to aim first at
the introduction of money; secondly, at its retention. It was to
these objects that the frequent ordinances and statutes with regard to
trade were directed. Although very various and, as such regulations
were almost certain to be, frequently inefficacious, they were energetic
and simple. England was not as yet a manufacturing country.
Its trade was an export trade of raw materials, principally derived
from sheep farming on the vast spaces of uncultivated land which
then existed, and from its mineral wealth. Its principal commodities
were wool, sheep-skins, or wool-fells, and leather, together with tin
and lead.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Only the coarsest kind of cloth was manufactured; sometimes
intentionally rough and coarse, to be changed into fine cloth
afterwards in Flanders, but exported as cloth to avoid the tax on
wool. Primitive trade, when the seas were beset with pirates, had
been carried on chiefly inland, and great fairs, such as that of Troyes
in France, had been established under the guardianship of feudal
lords, who guaranteed the safety of the merchants for a toll. Domestic
trade was carried on in the same way, and one of the forms of
royal exaction was to open a fair, and insist upon all other shops and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
other places of sale being closed during its continuance.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> As the seas
became safer, and the mercantile spirit of the Flemings rose, the great
free cities of Flanders became as it were perpetual fairs, and were
known as staples, from the German “stapeln,” <em>to keep up</em>.
In order that trade should be well under command, it
was necessary that it should be carried on in few channels. The English
government had therefore chosen some of these Flemish towns, and ordered
that all the chief productions of England, which have been already
mentioned, should be sold in those towns, and nowhere else. These
goods were therefore called staple commodities; the merchants who
traded in them, the merchants of the staple. And this staple trade was
put under an organization&mdash;there being a mayor, a constable, and courts
of the staple. At these staple towns, the King’s customers, or custom-house
officers, by means of this organization, had every bargain under
direct supervision; and every bargain thus supervised was obliged to
be made for a certain sum of actual coin, the government thus securing
a continual flow of silver into the hands of the English merchants.
The staple towns were frequently changed. To reward any particularly
faithful ally, or to raise the importance of any particular town,
as for instance Calais, the staple was removed to that Prince’s province,
or to that town. The proportion of each bargain to be brought
over in coin was also constantly varying. Indeed, the frequent
interference of government in such matters was not among the least
of the restrictions of trade. Edward III. was said, at one time of his
life, to have had a different plan every month. Upon the whole,
however, the principle was the same. Amongst the most remarkable
plans of Edward III. was one for keeping the evident riches that
accrued to the staple towns within the limits of England. In the
twenty-seventh year of his reign he named nine towns in England
which were to be the exclusive selling places of the English staple
commodities. For an Englishman to carry such commodities beyond
the seas was punishable by death. As Edward could not protect the
foreign merchants visiting his staples, and as the additional trouble of
purchasing goods at them naturally lowered prices, this plan did not
answer. It was, in fact, suicidal for an island people, since it destroyed
all object in the keeping up a mercantile navy. It was therefore
speedily abandoned; and after the reign of Henry VI., Calais became
the sole English staple town. A similar attempt was made in the
fourteenth year of Richard II., when it was enacted that no Englishman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
should buy wool except of the owners of the sheep, and for his
own use. The export trade was thus again for a time given over to
the foreign merchant, for the sake of securing to the wool-grower the
profits of the retail as well as the wholesale trade; the effect was
naturally a decrease of purchasers, which reduced the growers to great
distress. The government had, by insisting on money payments in
every bargain, secured an influx of silver; but as the nation was too
far advanced in civilization to do without foreign products, there
were a certain number of foreign importers, who threatened in their
turn to withdraw it again. One or two attempts were indeed made
to confine English trade to the limits of the country. Thus, it
was the view of Simon de Montfort, who disliked all extravagance in
dress, that the production of the country was enough to supply its
own inhabitants; and in 1261, and in 1271, exportation of English
wool was forbidden, and people acquired the habit of dressing in
undyed native cloth. Such primitive patriotism could not last in an
advancing nation. Trade soon resumed its old course. The greater
part of the foreign merchants were Germans, and to keep them under
government supervision, they were formed into a guild, given certain
privileges, allowed to possess a guild-hall, and are generally known
as the Merchants of the Steelyard.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Other alien merchants there also
were, who were protected by law; notably by the great statute of
Edward I., “De mercatoribus.” But although the goods they brought
were necessary, their bargains, no less than those of the staple merchants,
were under supervision. They were bound to employ a
certain proportion of the money obtained from their sales in English
goods.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Moreover, all foreign merchants were held to be mutually
responsible for each other’s debts. Thus the retention of the silver
in England was also secured, while, to avoid any varieties in the value
of money, English coin alone was current, and foreign coin had at
once to be exchanged at the royal exchangers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Coinage.</div>

<p>Since money was so important an object, the coinage was naturally
regarded with great care. It was an exclusive royal
monopoly, and in the reign of Edward III. the punishment
of death was enacted against false coiners. There was a constant
dread lest in the exchange England should be the loser. The
belief was prevalent that the value of the money depended upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
denomination. It had not yet entered men’s minds to think that it
was but another commodity, worth exactly its intrinsic value, which
no change of name could alter. Up till the reign of Edward III.,
although clipped and lightened in use, and although Edward I. had
begun the bad practice of depreciating the coin by diminishing its
legal weight, the coinage had been on the whole but little tampered
with. But between the years 1344 and 1351, the number of silver
pennies made from the pound of silver had increased from 243 to 270.
In that year, groats of the nominal value of 4d., but of the weight of
only three and a half of the diminished penny, were issued. It is
impossible to make any true estimate of the comparative value of
money then and at the present time. The facts with regard to the
actual amount of silver employed are these: The pound, which only
nominally existed, was a full pound of silver, which would at present
be coined into £2, 16s. 3d. The shilling, which seems also to have
been a nominal coin, was the twentieth part of this, or 2s. 9¾d. The
silver penny, which was, till the time of Edward III., almost the
only coin, was therefore worth 2¾d. Edward introduced several new
coins; some of gold, which, as there was no fixed proportion between
them and silver, were not popular, and were recalled; and nobles of
the value of 6s. 8d., or half a mark; together with the groats above
mentioned. But of the purchasing value of the money thus made no
fixed estimate can be given, as that of course depends upon the
relative value of the articles purchased; and under the very different
circumstances of those times the relative value of those articles was so
different, that to compare the value of money with any one of them
would give a totally false impression. It is usual to say roughly that
to reach the present value of any sum mentioned it should be multiplied
by fifteen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Guilds.</div>

<p>This form of commerce, restricted as has been before explained, was
certain to break down as the wants of the nation increased.
There was a company of merchant adventurers
founded, perhaps, though this seems very uncertain, as early as
Henry III.’s reign, which had the right to trade in other commodities
besides the staple, and to choose its own ports. It was the growth of
this company which, in the next century, had most to do with breaking
down the staple monopoly. It is needless to point out the bad
effects which this constant interference must have produced. It is
certain that the foreign merchant paid himself well for the extreme
difficulties placed in the way of his business; while, at the same time,
the difficulties of procuring foreign articles of luxury must have gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
far to render the habits of ordinary life rough and simple. The
same principle of restriction, which was established in the commerce
of the country, existed in the retail trade. The towns of England
were of natural and accidental growth, accumulations of men
who had gathered for purposes of self-defence or convenience, living
in accordance with the ordinary habits of the country, in the same
position, in fact, with regard to the king and their lords as any
other society of men&mdash;citizens originally by right of the possession of
land, and as the system of lordship established itself, bound to
customary duties to their lord, just as the inhabitants of the country
were. In the same way the citizens of the town, with the exception of
these customary duties, were free and self-governing. They gradually,
and chiefly by means of purchase, obtained freedom from the customary
duties, and thus became independent, self-governing communities.
Charters securing them freedom, in the case of the royal cities at all
events, were many of them due to the necessities of the Angevin kings,
and to their want of money for the payment of their mercenary troops.
The close neighbourhood of the inhabitants of towns early introduced
an artificial system of union, analogous to the frankpledge. Men
formed themselves into what were known as frith-guilds,<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> the
members of which were mutually responsible for one another, met at
periodical feasts, supported one another’s poor, and in other respects
performed the duties of members of an artificial family. As trade increased
these guilds in the generality of cases coalesced into one, which
took upon itself the direction of trade, and was known as the
merchant guild. With the natural tendency of a governing body,
this old merchant guild became exceedingly exclusive. New-comers
to the town were not admitted to it, and craftsmen were generally
excluded from its limits. In turn those craftsmen established guilds
of their own, known as craft-guilds, by the warden and leaders of which
the bye-laws of the particular craft were formed. Between these and
their aristocratic neighbours, the merchant guild, quarrels arose, and in
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the contest between the two was
fought out, the craft-guilds eventually securing their acknowledgment
and a share in the government of the town. Speaking generally, therefore,
we may conceive of the towns of England as being divided into a
series of guilds, the leaders of which usually formed a governing
body, and which were capable of making bye-laws for their own
special members. The commercial aim of these associations was, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
insure good work, to insure work for all its members, and to resist
that spirit of competition which was gradually rising, and which ended
in the creation of two classes, the capitalist and the workman. To
secure these objects, they limited the number of master workmen,
admitted candidates to their association only after lengthened
apprenticeships, limited the number of apprentices each master might
employ, and kept a close supervision over the articles made, which
were usually authenticated by the corporation mark.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>These restrictions upon industry at the close of our period were
beginning to break down; round the master workmen, there was
arising a class of journeymen or day labourers, whose ranks were constantly
swelled by fugitive serfs from the country; while, on the other
side, individual enterprise was making itself felt, and capital was being
collected, the owners of which refused to submit to the old corporation
laws. The constant supervision both of trade and of the work of
artisans supported the notion that governing bodies had the right to
set prices on the articles under their control, a principle which was
used not only by the guilds, but by the Government, as when, in the
famine years of 1315 and 1316, it prescribed the exact price of all
articles of food. As this had the natural effect of keeping things
entirely out of the market, so that butcher’s meat disappeared
altogether, it was shortly repealed; the prices to be demanded for
victuals were constantly subject to the supervision of justices. The
assize of bread, which is commonly assigned to the fifty-first year of
Henry III., 1266, regulated the price in accordance with the market
prices of corn, but the assizes of other matters, such as wine, wood,
fish, fowls, etc., seem to have been perfectly arbitrary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ships.</div>

<p>Though thus restricted, the trade of the English was very considerable.
Their ships reached into the Baltic, where a constant communication
was kept up with the Teutonic order, to whom Prussia
belonged. The intercourse with that order was close. We hear of
Henry, the first Duke of Lancaster, the Earl of Derby, afterwards
Henry IV., and Thomas of Gloucester, repairing to their assistance.
But the English merchants could never secure an equality of rights
in the Baltic, the trade of which was regarded as a monopoly by the
Hanseatic towns. English ships also visited Spain, so that Chaucer
could describe his experienced shipman as knowing all the harbours
from Gothland to Finnisterre;<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> while Venetian and Genoese merchants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
in whose hands the whole trade of the East was, brought
their goods largely to England; indeed, in 1379, a Genoese merchant
is said to have suggested to Richard II. to make Southampton the
emporium of all the oriental trade of the North. So great was the
importance of the English shipping, that Edward III. distinctly
claimed for himself and his predecessors the dominion of the sea.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
The ships were, however, though numerous, of small burden; in the
great fleet employed by Edward at Calais, there were 710 vessels,
with crews amounting to 14,151 persons, which would
give an average crew of about twenty men; and as it is
said that there were about sixty-five sailors to every hundred tons, it
would make the average size of the vessels very small. Indeed, a
ship manned by thirty seamen, employed to convey Edward I. to the
Continent, was regarded as a wonder for its size. Of navy, properly
speaking, there was little or none. There were only twenty-five royal
ships at Calais, the rest were all merchantmen pressed for the service.
About this time it became habitual to put cannon on board ships. When
used for military purposes, they were manned by troops and archers.</p>

<p>It has been mentioned that the trade of England was almost
entirely in raw materials. The cloth manufactured had hitherto been
of the roughest description, but Edward III., true to his view of
keeping English trade for the English, and moved perhaps by the
wealth of his allies the Flemish, attempted to introduce the manufacture
of finer cloths. In 1331, he invited weavers and fullers from
Flanders, and the patent exists which he gave to one John Kempe, to
practise and teach his mystery.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> This seems to have been the
beginning of the finer cloth manufactures of England.</p>

</div>

<p>The fact of so much trouble being taken to organize trade shows
the extent of it, and in spite of all ignorance and mismanagement, it
was certain to produce wealth. The standard of comfort among all
classes was improving, though there was nothing like what we should
now speak of as luxury. The furniture used, even in the
houses of the rich, was still rude. Things which are now
found everywhere, and taken as matters of course, were then valuable
rarities&mdash;beds, bedsteads, and rich clothing were frequently left by
will. The lists of moveables, on which taxes were paid, are exceedingly
meagre. A stool or two, a chest, and a few metal pots,
constituted the ordinary supply of furniture. In the houses of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
very rich, art had indeed begun to show itself. The payments of
Henry III. to foreign artists for paintings in his house are mentioned.
Intercourse with the French, and especially with the Spaniards,
tended to increase these more luxurious habits. Carpets had always
been used by Eastern people, and the Moors had introduced the
custom in Spain. Thus, on the marriage of Edward I., before the
arrival of Eleanor of Castile, her brother, the Archbishop of Toledo,
made his appearance. The hangings of his chamber excited the
wonder of the people, and Edward, always inclined to ostentation,
had the rooms of the bride elect similarly decorated. This is said to
have been the introduction of carpets to England; but still the
usual covering of the floor was rushes. There is frequent mention of
payments for rushes for the King’s chambers. In the matter of clothes
the same change is observable. The extravagant court of Edward II.
is said to have introduced parti-coloured garments. In Edward III’s
reign, wealth had so increased in all ranks that it was
found necessary to pass sumptuary laws, sharply dividing
classes by the dress they were allowed to wear, and to confine silk
and the finer woollen cloths to the higher ranks, for the sake
perhaps of the English wool manufactures. In Richard II.’s reign,
extravagance went still further. With his Queen, Anne of Bohemia,
came in the awkward habit, soon adopted by all classes, of wearing
long shoes, called cracowys or pykys, which required to be tied with
silver chains to the knee before the wearer could move.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> And Stowe
says that Richard himself wore a garment made of gold, silver, and
precious stones, worth 3000 marks. At the same time
the rich built more comfortable houses. Castles ceased
to be mere places of defence. They were at once strongholds and
handsome dwelling-places. Warwick and Windsor castles may be
looked on as fair specimens of the more magnificent buildings of the
time. Meanwhile, though among the few, and on special occasions,
splendour was found, houses, even in the streets of considerable
towns, such as Colchester, the tenth city of the empire, were still
built of mud. In Edward III.’s reign, it was still necessary to issue
frequent orders for the cleansing of the streets of London, that his
courtiers might not get into difficulties as they moved from Westminster
to the City. Filth accumulated in the narrow by-lanes; and,
as in the East, crows were held sacred as the only scavengers. Pavement
there was none, and lanterns were hoisted from the top of Bow
Church, to guide the wayfarer through the paths of the heaths that
surrounded the metropolis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Food.</div>

<p>Barbaric profusion in the matter of food made up for the want of
substantial comforts. At the coronation of Edward I.,
380 head of cattle, 430 sheep, 450 pigs, 18 wild boars,
278 flitches of bacon, and 20,000 capons, was the amount of food
provided. The conduits ran wine, and hundreds of knights, who
attended the great nobles, let their horses run free, to be the prize of
the first captor. In 1399, at a Christmas feast of Richard II., there
were daily killed twenty-eight oxen and 300 sheep, beside numberless
fowl. Richard of Cornwall, at his marriage, is said to have invited
30,000 guests; while we are told that the usual household of Richard
II. numbered 10,000. But though at these great festivals there was
vast abundance of meat, at other times, especially at the Church fasts,
fish, often of the coarsest sort, was eaten. The wife of Simon de
Montfort ate the tongue of a whale dressed with peas, and a porpoise
dressed with furmenty, saffron and sugar. Enormous quantities of
herrings were consumed, spoken of as Aberdeens; in six days of
March, Eleanor de Montfort’s household consumed no less than 3000.
Her meals were diversified by dog-fish, stock-fish, conger eels, and
cod. Wine was drunk in great quantities, frequently mixed with
honey. Hops, though known in Flanders, had not been introduced;
the beer which was largely consumed was made of any grain, and
seasoned with pepper.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The House of
Commons.</div>

<p>It was the increasing wealth of the country, especially of the
mercantile classes, which had caused their introduction
to Parliament. Thither they came with all the exclusive
notions which their trade traditions had fostered. They were as
careless of the class below them as the Barons. Indeed, it would be
true to say that the feeling of the House of Commons was completely
aristocratic. One part of it was of necessity entirely so: the knights
of the shire, originally the representatives of the lower baronage,
were elected in the county court, which was the general meeting-place
of all freeholders, whether they held immediately from the
crown or not. Consequently, the baronial freeholders became
merged in the lesser freeholders, and the class of gentry was created.
Many things had tended to the increase of that class. The breaking
up of great properties, the division of property among younger
children, and alienation, had increased the number of freeholders.
The statute “Quia Emptores,” intended as a check upon subinfeudation,
had really increased alienation by authorizing it. The smaller
estates, thus separated from the large baronies, had to be worked to
profit, and could not be regarded merely as means of military or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
political influence. There thus had arisen an industrial as well as a
military class of landholders. The representatives of towns, also
elected upon a writ directed to the Sheriff, were, if not at first,
certainly soon after elected in the county courts. This similarity of
election united the two classes in feeling; and the smaller baronies,
small landowners, and burghers, formed the body of representative
Commons, aristocratic in feeling in accordance with the origin of the
more aristocratic part of the class. It is thus that we find the
Commons regarding the Barons as their natural leaders, not joining
the crown against them as in France. Edward III., in his difficulties
with Stratford, had tried to produce this combination, but had failed;
and the Commons joining with the Barons, had insisted on the
restoration to favour of that prelate. And thus, too, we find the
Commons without sympathy with the demands of the rebels in Wat
Tyler’s insurrection. They had, indeed, certain grievances of their
own, on which they were always petitioning, such as the encroachments
of the King’s purveyors, and the too great authority, sometimes
misused, of the sheriffs. But apart from these particular
wrongs, they may be regarded as siding as a whole with the Barons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opposition to
the church.</div>

<p>In their hatred to the Church they made common cause with all
classes. The peculiar position which the submission of
John had given the Popes in England was the primary
cause of this dislike. Annates, or first-fruits, had been early demanded,
but the great grievance, as we have seen, was Provisors.
Against this assumption of authority, which forestalled the rights of
the patrons, there was the strongest feeling. The exactions of the
Pope had been strongly spoken of in the Statute of Carlisle in the
end of Edward’s I.’s reign. Edward II., like other weak princes,
had yielded to this assumption. But in Edward III.’s reign, a series
of enactments were passed, each one stronger than the last, against
the interference of the Papacy. In 1343 the Statute of Carlisle had
been read, and it was enacted that no more Papal instruments should
be allowed in England. In 1344, the penalty of exile was pronounced
against all provisors. By a Statute of the 25th year of
Edward III.’s reign, it was ordained that “kings and all other lords
were to present unto benefices, of their own or their ancestor’s foundation,
and not the Pope of Rome.” If the Pope interfered the matter
was to come into the King’s hands, and penalties were enacted. In
the 38th year of his reign these enactments were all confirmed and
strengthened by the Statute of Provisors, by which the introduction
of Papal Bulls and Briefs was forbidden. The strife, as we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
seen, was continued in Richard II.’s reign, and finally completed in
the 16th year of that King, by a statute declaring the freedom of the
crown of England, which was in earthly subjection to no realm,
and pronouncing the penalties of the Præmunire against all who
should purchase or procure any Bulls from the Court of Rome; any
who were guilty of this should be put out of the King’s peace, and
forfeit all their property. In Edward III.’s reign, also, the annual
tribute, or census, as it was called, of a thousand marks was left
unpaid. At the end of Edward I.’s reign 17,000 marks had become
due. Edward II. paid this, and continued throughout his reign to
discharge the debt. Edward III. was again strong enough to refuse
the payment, and in 1366, Urban V. demanded the arrears of thirty-three
years. The King laid the matter before his Parliament, and
an instrument was drawn up in the name of the King, Lords, and
Commons, declaring that John had acted without the advice of his
realm, and that any demand for the money would be resisted to the
utmost. It was not again claimed. But it was not against the
Roman Church only that the popular feeling had been aroused. The
Church itself had become unpopular. The wealth and idleness of
the older monastic orders, the spiritual encroachments and licentious
lives of the new mendicant orders, had excited popular anger. The
charges against them are humorously summed up in the Song of the
Order of Fair-ease, a description of an imaginary order, to which
each existing class of monks subscribes a characteristic or two. The
monks of Beverley give the habit of deep drinking, in which they
are joined by the Black Monks; the Hospitallers dress well and
amble fairly on grey palfreys; the Secular Canons are the willing
servants of the ladies; the Grey Monks are given to licentiousness;
while the Friars Minor, whose order is founded on poverty, will
never lodge with a poor man so long as there are richer men to be
found. In the same way the constant interference of the consistory
courts was the cause of popular complaint. “Yet there sit somnours,
six or seven, misjudging all men alike, and reach forth their roll:
herdsmen hate them, and every man’s servant, for every parish they
put in pain.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wicliffe.</div>

<p>To crown all, the doctrine itself of the Church had begun to be
questioned. In 1360, the name of Wicliffe first becomes
prominent. His first attack was upon the mendicant
orders, who had contrived to get into their hands much of the
education of the country. From this time onwards he continually
waged war against the abuses of the Church. The clergy, he urged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
should be poor, in imitation of Christ. This doctrine he carried out
by the establishment of an order of poor priests. With regard to
the Sacrament, he appealed to common sense; and while not yet
ready to attack the doctrine of Transubstantiation, upheld that the
elements taken were really bread and wine. But his great work was
neither his assault on the wealth of the clergy, nor his attack on their
doctrine, but the translation of the Bible into English, which was,
in fact, an appeal to private judgment in opposition to ecclesiastical
authority. His influence was very widespread. His poor priests
worked largely among the lower orders, and his view of the necessity
of poverty for the clergy was so in harmony with the feelings of the
day, that it met with ready acceptance. As has been mentioned, the
Church was too strong for him. He was obliged, when the support
of John of Gaunt failed him, to make some sort of recantation, and
retire to his living of Lutterworth. But his disciples are said to have
numbered a third of the population of England, and when, as was
inevitable, social and political views were added to their religious
doctrines, they became an object of dread, not only to the Church,
but also to the Government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lower
classes.</div>

<p>It is perhaps in the lower commons that social change is most
obvious. The great insurrection of Wat Tyler is a sign
of something more than mere temporary discontent.
Agricultural villeinage was disappearing, and giving birth to a new
class almost peculiar to England, the free but landless labourer. The
existence of this class first comes prominently into notice in the
Statute of Labourers. In the terrible pestilence of the Black Death
which had ravaged England, a third, perhaps a half, of the population
had been carried off. Labour became scarce. The labourers
took the opportunity of making what we should now call a strike for
higher wages. Such a demand, however consonant with economical
principles, was quite repugnant to the feelings of that age, when
prices were a constant matter of legal enactment. The Statute of
Labourers, stating in its preamble that servants, taking advantage of
the necessities of their masters, would not serve except for excessive
wages, enacted that every able-bodied man should be bound to serve
any one who required him at the old wages under pain of imprisonment;
and that every master giving more than the old wages should
forfeit thrice the sum he had offered. Such an ordinance could not
be kept; but strenuous efforts were made to insist upon it, and again
and again in some form or other it was re-enacted. But whether
successful or not, it shows the existence of labour for wages, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
of a rising knowledge on the part of the labourers of the value of
their work. Several causes combined to create this labouring class.
The early form of agricultural society may be roughly described as a
village of serfs lying round the manor-house of their lord. Each serf
had his share in the common fields of the village, and was bound to
join in the cultivation of his lord’s domain or manor farm. For
the simple farming at that time prevalent this forced labour was
sufficient; and the lord valued his serfs more for military purposes
than as agricultural labourers. As subinfeudation and alienation
went on, the holders of small properties were obliged to work their
land to better profit. The alienations also were chiefly made from the
lord’s domain, but it was not usual to part with serfs. Consequently,
their number increased, while the domain land diminished; there
were more hands than the lord could employ, and the tenant working
for profit could therefore find labour among the surplus serfs who would
work for wages. A change in the character of war took place at the
same time. The insular condition of England made the feudal
arrangement with its limited term of service inconvenient; in the
highest ranks, therefore, military service was changed to scutage or
money payment, and a large number of dependants became less desirable
than money; proprietors were willing to work their farms with fewer
servants and to receive money rent instead of service. There were
thus at work the two principles which broke down villein labour;
labour paid by wages, and land held for money rent. The change in
war had another effect. Armies were raised by contract with some
great lord. The payment was beyond the ordinary agricultural
wages. The earl himself received a mark a day, the common foot-soldier,
3d. or 4d., and the archer, 6d.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Anxious to fulfil his contract,
the leader would not be careful to inquire whether he was enlisting
serfs or not. On his return from a war, the well-paid soldier would be
unwilling to fall back into a state of serfdom. He swelled the ranks
of wage-paid labour. Again, the residence of a year and a day uninterrupted
within the limits of a borough gave freedom. Serfs, seeing
the advantage of money payments, fled thither and became free.
Again, the Church, in whose eyes all men were equal, would not refuse
to admit them within its ranks; a serf could thus become a priest or
monk, and withdraw himself from his lord’s power. On the same
principle, the Church constantly urged the manumission of serfs. To
all these causes was now added the disarrangement of labour consequent
on the Black Death. With a general demand for labour all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
superfluous hands would find easy employment, perhaps at a considerable
distance from their old homes. With a sufficient supply himself,
the lord would not waste time or money to redeem them. We thus
see how there may have been a vast number of free labourers in
England. The Statute of Labourers, destroying their freedom of
bargain, attempted, though with but partial success, to force these free
labourers back into a semi-servile condition. But they had now
joined the ranks of freemen, such as the small farmers of Kent, and
the unincorporated artisans of towns. The spirit of equality fostered
by the teaching of the mendicant friars, who had reached England in
Henry III.’s reign, and who took up their abode among the poor city
populations, was still further increased by the teaching of Wicliffe
and his poor priests.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“When Adam delved and Eve span,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who was then the gentleman?”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">a doggerel couplet frequent in the mouths of the insurgents of
1382, shows how the lessons of the Bible made public by Wicliffe’s
translation could be turned in the same direction. The feeling that it
was the plebeian archer, and not the lordly man-at-arms, who had
won the great victories in France, and the success with which, during
the last half century, the smaller trade corporations had in the
cities forced themselves into an equality with the great ones, all led
to the same democratic feeling. The lower freemen made common
cause with the villeins. They had all felt the heavy pressure of the
tax-gatherer. The popular songs of the day are full of wretchedness.
One, said to belong to the reign of Edward I. or II., speaks thus&mdash;</p>

<p>“To seek silver for the King, I sold my seed, wherefore my land
lies fallow and learns to sleep. Since they fetched my fair cattle in
my fold, when I think of my old wealth I nearly weep; this breeds
many bold beggars. There wakes in the world consternation and
woe, as good is it to perish at once, as so to labour.”<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The
democratic outbreak of Wat Tyler was the consequence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The nobility.</div>

<p>While the two sections of the commons were thus rising in social
position, a change had also taken place in the character of the nobility.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
It may be roughly characterized as the change from feudalism to
chivalry.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Many of the same causes which had conduced
to the freedom of the labourer had tended to loosen the
territorial system on which the ancient strength of the nobility rested.
Especially had the voluntary character of military service dealt heavy
blows at the practical side of feudalism. Soldiering was no longer
the necessary duty of every man; but the military spirit remained,
and to the bulk of the aristocracy fighting became a pastime. The
subordination of proprietors gave place to a sort of system of freemasonry,
to which all knights were admitted. Knighthood made its
holder any man’s equal for actual military purposes. It was no
longer the great noble, but the good soldier, who was the commander.
Manny, Chandos, Knowles, all of them simple knights, were the
generals to whom Edward III. trusted. As an amusement war was
decked with ostentatious ornament. This is the period of showy tournaments,
of armorial bearings, and of grotesque vows, like that of the
young knights who attended Edward with black patches over their
eyes. It is this chivalrous aspect of war which explains the short-lived
character of Edward’s expeditions. But it had a more important
effect. Importance in the country became a more personal
matter; partly from love of show, partly to produce respect, great
men began to surround themselves, not with feudal followers, but
with paid retainers. To these they granted liveries. It was a point
of honour among these retainers to stand by each other and by their
chief. Quite in the beginning of Richard II.’s reign, the Commons
petitioned against these liveries and the bands of maintainers,<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> who
upheld each other in illegal actions. Thus great households, and by
degrees factions, were formed, and things were ready for the great
outbreak of faction fighting, which ended in the destruction of the
old nobility in the Wars of the Roses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Literature.</div>

<p>The feeling of national life, which is one of the characteristics of
the time, had shown itself in literature. Public transactions
were still carried on in French or Latin; but
it will be remembered that as early as the Provisions of Oxford it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
had been found necessary to publish any important proclamation in
English as well. Up till that time the languages of the nobility and
of the common people had been distinct. From that time onwards
they begin to blend. This, as it happens, can be very well observed.
Geoffrey of Monmouth wrote a Latin Chronicle of England in 1130.
Before the end of the century it was versified by two writers; one
wrote for the nobles and the aristocracy, the other for the common
people. Master Wace, a native of Jersey, translated Geoffrey for
Henry II. into Norman-French. Layamon, who wrote about 1180,
translated it into a language which may be fairly called Anglo-Saxon,
although of a somewhat degraded type. We have here a
perfect division of the languages. But about the middle of the next
century the same work was translated by Robert of Gloucester. In
his language there is a much nearer approach to English, and a considerable
number of French words are easily to be traced. Some
fifty years afterwards, Robert Mannyng, or De Brunne, again rewrote
the Chronicle; and again the further introduction of French words is
striking. We have thus means of testing, as it were, at three different
points, the process of amalgamation that was going forward. The
Court language still continued to be French, but French not much
like the language of France, and it was ceasing to be thoroughly
understood by the bulk of the people. By the time that Chaucer
wrote, he could laugh at English-French. His Prioress spoke Cockney-French,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry" lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">
<p class="verseq">“After the scole of Stratford atte Bowe,</p>
<p class="verse0">For Frenche of Paris was to hire unknowe.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">And in recommending English writing, he says,&mdash;“<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">Certes there ben
some that speke thyr poysy mater in Frensche, of whyche speche the
Frensche men have as good a fantasye as we have in hearing of
Frensche mennes Englyshe.</span>” This indeed was to be expected. From
the Conquest the language of schools had been French; but in 1356,
John of Cornwall had begun a change in this habit, and taught Latin
translation by means of English, and not French. The consequence, as
described by Trevisa, was, their “<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">avauntage is, that thei lerneth her
gramer in lasse tyme than children were wont to do; desavauntage
is, that now children of gramer scole kunneth no more Frensch than
her lifte heele.</span>” Other signs also point to this change. Latin had
ceased to be the language of public documents in the reign of Edward I.
In 1362, in answer it appears to a petition from the Commons, the
opening address delivered in Parliament was in English, and the
Commons’ debates in English also. At the same time it was ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
that English should be the language of courts of law, because the
French tongue was too much unknown. But it was not till the reign
of Richard III. that the statutes and rolls of Parliament were written
in English. It is probable that Parliamentary business continued to
be carried on in both languages for some time longer. In 1381
English seems to have been generally used. There were thus during
this period extant three languages for literary purposes&mdash;Latin, the
language of learned men and historians; French, an acquired Court
language, in which most of the legends of chivalry and lengthened
rhyming chronicles were produced; and the gradually rising English
language, which, as the popular tongue, was chiefly employed in songs
and political satire. The earliest form of English poetry was alliterative,&mdash;metrical,
but without rhyme, and depending for its effect upon a
certain number of words in each couplet beginning with the same
letter. But rhyme, and not only rhyme, but very easy and varied
metres, were introduced as early as the reign of Henry III. Not
unfrequently both principles were blended, and rhyme and alliteration
occur together. Latin was also employed, we must suppose by
the clergy, in satirical songs. All classical metres were then discarded,
and Latin was used as a rhyming language. There are some instances
also of verses, partly in one language, partly in the other. It may be
worth while to give an instance of two of these various metres. Thus
a verse of a song shortly after the battle of Lewes runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry" lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">
<p class="verseq">“Sire Simond de Mountfort hath swore bi ys chyn,</p>
<p class="verse0">Hevede he nou here the Erl of Waryn,</p>

<p class="verse8">To help of Wyndesore.</p>
<p class="verse4">Richard, thah thou be ever trichard,</p>
<p class="verse6">Trichen shalt thou never more.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">This is rhyme, the rhythm is free, and there is a refrain. In the
following verse, from a satire on the consistory courts, alliteration
and rhyme go together:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry" lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">
<p class="verseq">“Ther sitteth somenours syexe other sevene</p>

<p class="verse2">Ant clastreth with heore colle.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>The next specimen, from a song on the venality of judges, shows
how Latin was adapted to modern versification:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p class="verse0">Quod censum dant diabolo</p>
<p class="verse6">et serviunt hii pure.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">While in the next verse is shown the mixture of two languages; it is
drawn from a song against the King’s taxes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry" lang="la" xml:lang="la">

<p class="verse2">Nam quæ taxantur, regi non omnia dantur.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>These satirical poems are directed against nearly every class of
society, the monks, the judges, the taxers, the nobility, the ladies, the
logicians of the university, and even the doctors meet with their
share of abuse. The democratic spirit which is visible in them found
a more complete and worthy expression in the poem known by the
name of the Vision and Creed of Piers Ploughman. It is supposed
to be the work of a poet of the name of Langland. The form is
allegorical, a form which the great celebrity of the French “Romance
of the Rose” made permanent both in France and England for many
years. A pilgrim of quite the lowest rank sees in a vision virtues
and vices pass before him, and also representatives of all the various
classes of society. Each in turn is criticised; none can lead him in
the path of virtue, till Peter the Ploughman appears, who, in a
religious conversation, shows him the right way. His character is
one of typical perfection, and becomes confused towards the end of
the poem with that of Christ. The poem is written in alliterative
verse, and in English by no means so much like our present English
as some of the songs that preceded it. But at length the time was
come for the complete nationalization of the language. French was
in decay, the popular songs were in rude English, and when the union
of all classes in Parliament had completed the real nationality, any
further division of the languages was impossible. The junction was
effected by Chaucer. He set himself intentionally to work to make
a compound and national tongue. He took for its basis the English;
and on it he grafted, sometimes in their own form, sometimes in an
altered form, vast numbers of French words. It is a curious instance
of an intentional formation of a language. Many words he admitted
apparently upon trial, and they have been rejected. Others have
been somewhat changed in form, but in his works we have a language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
which a very little trouble will enable any Englishman to read, and
the grammar and structure of which, with few exceptions, is like our
own English. The great work for which he employed this language,
the “Canterbury Tales,” was well fitted to establish it. While the
prologue describes every class of English society, each drawn with an
incomparable delicacy and humour, the tales which form the bulk of
the work are of every description. Love romances for the knights;
coarse or farcical incidents for the commonalty; sober religious prose
for the serious. Compared with this poem, there is nothing for more
than a century worthy of mention. Gower, who wrote at the same
time with Chaucer, and in the three languages, is wholly deficient in
humour, and heavy and prosaic to the last degree. His followers in
the next century, Lydgate and Occleve, were poets by profession and
not by inspiration, always ready to turn out a poem upon demand.
Chaucer was not only the founder of the English language, but,
before the appearance of Spenser, the only great poet whom England
produced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry’s
position in
English history.
1399.</div>

<p class="drop-cap">The reign of Richard II., with its strange and rapid revolutions,
had been the beginning of that great faction fight which was
concluded a century afterwards by the accession of
Henry VII. After pursuing during that reign a policy
of inconsistent, and even treacherous, self-seeking, the
Duke of Lancaster now came forward as the champion of order. The
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’état</i> by which he put himself on the throne is another of those
instances which history has so abundantly furnished, of the willing
acceptance by a nation, after a period of long discomfort, of any one
who would bring it rest. There are thus two points of view from
which to regard his reign. It is the reign of a usurper bent upon
establishing a dynasty, the reign of a conservative who bases his
position on the maintenance of the existing state of society, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
therefore for a time checks the natural progress of the nation. The
necessity which a usurper feels for popularity will explain the
improved constitutional position of the Commons during the earlier
years of his reign; his position as a reactionary that attachment to
the Church which produced the famous statute, “De Hæretico comburendo.”</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Tumultuous
scene in the

<div class="sidenotex">The King’s
insecure position
for nine

1400.</div>
</div>

<p>The arbitrary character of the government at the close of the late
King’s reign, and the acts of vengeance which had marked it, were
the evils which were most prominent at the moment.
Henry’s first step was of necessity the reversal of these
acts, and the restoration of the state of things which had
existed in 1388. The Parliament was therefore induced to declare all
the acts of the last Parliament null, while those nobles whose
adhesion to the late King had procured them fresh rank fell back to
their old titles. Thus, the Dukes of Albemarle, of Surrey, and of
Exeter, appear again as the Earls of Rutland, Kent, and Huntingdon,
the Marquis of Dorset as Earl of Somerset. The scene
in the House of Lords in the first Parliament marks the
pitch to which passion had risen, and the preparation
already made for future civil war. Rutland, the son of the Duke of
York, was challenged by Lord Fitz-Walter, and when Lord Morley,
the friend of the new King, challenged Lord Salisbury, no less than
forty lords threw down their hoods as gages of battle on one side or
the other. This point is further illustrated by the petition of the
Commons, that all liveries except those of the King should be forbidden.
The nobles had been gathering paid retainers around
them, and getting themselves ready for the threatening quarrel.
Meanwhile, the King had been crowned, supported by his
two great partisans&mdash;whose names show the great influence of the
North in the late change of government&mdash;Percy, Earl of Northumberland,
now made Constable of England, and Neville, Earl of Westmoreland,
with the rank of Marshall. It by no means suited Henry
to excite remark as to his right. He therefore stepped as quietly as
he could into the position of his predecessor, and his son Henry was
declared Prince of Wales and heir-apparent, entirely without mention
of the young Earl of March, the real heir, who was then a child in
the custody of the King at Windsor. A grant of a tax on wool and
leather for three years closed the session, and enabled
Henry to take measures to secure his position; for it
was not to be supposed that the party which had lost its
influence would calmly acknowledge the new King. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
was scarcely crowned when plots began to be formed against him,
nor was it till he had been nine years upon the throne that the
dangers which assaulted him both from his own kingdom and from
foreign countries were finally overcome. It was during this period of
weakness and uncertainty that he had to rest principally upon the
Commons, who supported him as the champion of order against
baronial disorder, but did not fail to take advantage of his weakness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Insurrection of
the late Lords
Appellant.</div>

<p>The first of these difficulties arose from those lords who had been
the appellants against Gloucester, and whose loss of rank has been
already mentioned. A week before Christmas, 1399,
several others of the depressed party met at Westminster,
and there the Earls of Huntingdon, Rutland, Kent, and
Salisbury entered into a conspiracy for the restoration of Richard.
Their plan was to seize the King at Windsor, but Rutland, a never-failing
traitor, disclosed the project to his cousin; the King hastily
betook himself to London, and the insurgent lords, finding that their
plans were discovered, fell back towards the West. The King was
rapidly pursuing them; but at Cirencester, the inhabitants, under
their Mayor, surrounded their lodgings, took them prisoners, and afterwards
beheaded Kent and Salisbury. Several escaped for the time,
but the same fate at length overtook Despenser at Bristol, and
Huntingdon at Pleshy in Essex. Subsequently, Sir Thomas Blunt
and eighteen others were executed at Oxford. Among them was a
priest, Maudelin by name, who had been chosen for his strong
personal resemblance to represent the late King in the insurrection.
That the leaders of this conspiracy should have all fallen victims to
popular vengeance sufficiently shows the feelings of the bulk of the
nation with regard to King Henry and his rival.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Imprisonment
and secret death
of Richard.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, Richard had been imprisoned in Pontefract Castle. In
February a report was spread that he was dead. On this the Privy
Council begged that, if still alive, he might be carefully
secured. The answer was given that he was already
dead, and a corpse was exhibited in London, the face of
which, from the eyes to the chin, was left uncovered, the rest of the
body being carefully clothed. This peculiar arrangement excited
suspicions, which were probably groundless, but were further supported
by the complete mystery which hung over the manner
of the King’s death. Hunger and violence were both alleged;
while some asserted that the corpse exhibited was not that of Richard,
but of the priest Maudelin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<div class="sidenotex">Useless and

</div>

<p>His domestic enemies for the present silenced, Henry could look
abroad. He made advances towards friendship with
France, but it soon became plain that that kingdom was inclined
to support the cause of the late King, whose young
widow, Isabella, was the daughter of Charles VI. The title of King of
England was refused to Henry, Isabella and her dowry demanded,
and hostility thus kept continually alive. In Scotland, also, the
same feeling showed itself. The King, Robert III., was confined by
weakness of body and mind almost exclusively to the Isle of Bute;
his brother, the Duke of Albany, was the real ruler of the country.
Henry, who had a party in the country, and at whose court Dunbar,
the Earl of March, the chief enemy of the Douglas family, was
resident, thought it desirable to show his power. He therefore
marched as far as Leith, demanding homage from the
Scotch King similar to that claimed by his predecessors,
but the Duke of Rothesay, heir-apparent, held firm in the
Castle of Edinburgh, and want of provisions speedily obliged the
English to beat a somewhat hasty retreat. As in the case of France,
this transaction with Scotland established a constant hostility.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Insurrection in
Wales. Owen
Glendower.
1400.</div>

<p>In the other dependency of England affairs were still worse.
Owen Glendower, a Welsh gentleman of good family
educated in England, incensed at the rejection of a suit
about a certain property of Lord Grey of Ruthyn, had
roused the national animosity, and claimed for himself the title of
Prince of Wales. For the present Henry could do nothing effective
against him. The war assumed a national character; the Welsh
were expelled from the towns in the Marches. Edward I.’s statutes
against the Welsh were re-enacted, even including that which
ordered the destruction of the bards. The conduct of the war was
placed nominally in the hands of Henry, Prince of Wales, a lad of
thirteen. But the whole of the following year Glendower’s successes
continued. Grey of Ruthyn and Edward Mortimer, uncle of the
imprisoned Prince, the Earl of March, were taken prisoners, and an expedition
undertaken by Henry in person towards the close of the year
was forced to retire from the mountainous strongholds of the Welsh.
The storms and snowdrifts seemed to fight against them in that wild
district, and gave rise to the belief that Glendower was a magician.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Quarrel with

1402.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">The pretended
Richard.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Causes of the
quarrel with
Northumberland.</div>
</div>

<p>Could these various enemies but find some powerful adherents in
England, it was plain that Henry’s position would be
precarious. A quarrel with those who had hitherto
been his chief supporters, the Percies of Northumberland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
supplied this element of danger; while a strange report, that
the late King was still alive in Scotland, gave a central point round
which all Henry’s enemies might gather. About Whitsuntide, in
1402, the rumour reached England that Richard had
escaped from Pontefract, and had made his appearance
at the house of the Lord of the Isles, by whom he was handed over to
the Court, and there kept so strictly that no man could get sight of
him. The existence of such a pretender was certain. It was in vain
that Henry attempted to suppress the rumour by executions; in vain
that he even proceeded to execute certain Franciscan monks who had
been engaged in spreading it. The secrecy which covered Richard’s
death, and which for some reason Henry could not break, prevented
any clear proof of the imposture. The false Richard is believed to
have been a man of weak intellect, called Thomas Ward of Trumpington.
The reason of the King’s quarrel with the
Percies is by no means clear, but various causes of discontent
can be shown. The Duke of Albany, after
much fighting on the borders, had made an expedition on a large
scale against Carlisle. On its return home, the army, heavily laden
with booty, was met by the Percies, and defeated at Homildon Hill.
The defeat was complete; many Scotch nobles fell into the hands of
the English, among them Murdoch, Earl of Fife, the son and heir of
the Earl of Albany, and Douglas, Earl of Angus. For such prisoners
the Percies expected a large ransom. Their anger and disappointment
was great when the King took Murdoch from them and claimed
the ransom of the rest. A somewhat similar affair took place in
Wales. Of Glendower’s great prisoners, Grey of Ruthyn was
allowed to ransom himself, a privilege refused to Mortimer; when
the younger Percy, Hotspur, who had married Mortimer’s sister,
urged his claim, he met with a rebuff. The King also owed the
Percies large sums of money; £20,000 was due to them, which the
entanglement of the finances made it impossible to pay. The general
feeling that they had been badly rewarded for the invaluable assistance
they had afforded Henry, acting upon the unusually hot temper
of the younger Percy, drove them into a change of policy.</p>

</div>

<p>Before the end of the year 1402, they entered into negotiations
with Glendower; and Mortimer, instead of attempting
to gain his liberty, married the daughter of the insurgent
chief, and recognized him as Prince of Wales. The
Percies at the same time gained the assistance of their prisoner
Douglas, and the conspiracy was completed by the support given to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Glendower by France. On all sides the King’s difficulties seemed to
increase. The Earl of Worcester joined the Percies; Richard’s old
followers crowded to their standard, and an army, insidiously collected
as though for an attack on Scotland, rapidly marched on Shrewsbury
to make a junction with the Welsh. Thither Henry, with his son
the Prince of Wales, hastened, and the decisive battle of
Shrewsbury was fought, in which, after a keen struggle,
Hotspur was killed, and most of the other leaders,
including Worcester and Douglas, captured. Worcester and the
other English leaders were beheaded; Douglas was retained in prison.
The King had still to destroy the insurrection of the elder Percies in
the North, where all the inhabitants of the country had taken the
crescent&mdash;the livery of Northumberland. The royal
army was, however, obviously too strong for opposition,
and the Earl made his submission, and met the King at
York. The House of Peers claimed as a right the trial of their
fellow, and he was found guilty, not of high treason, but only of
misdemeanour, and let off with a fine.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Flight of the

</div>

<p>The great conspiracy was thus but half broken. Wales, Scotland,
France, and the English malcontents were still in communication.
From France, indeed, serious difficulties seemed to
threaten. In presence of the weakness of Charles VI.,
the King of that country, the real power was disputed by his
brother Louis of Orleans and his uncle the Duke of Burgundy.
Louis had at this time the upper hand. He took in great dudgeon the
events which had taken place in England; and rumours were abroad,
strengthened by the distribution among the malcontents of Richard’s
crest by the old Countess of Oxford, the mother of De Vere, the late
King’s favourite. These rumours pointed to a great conspiracy,
coupled with an invasion of Essex by France, in favour of the spurious
Richard in Scotland. For a time the threat of invasion
compelled the King to remain quiet; but after the French fleet,
which had attacked the Isle of Wight and Plymouth, had been
defeated at Portland, he was able to turn his attention to the North,
and again to compel Northumberland to come to an explanation. But
that explanation he found himself obliged to accept. Almost at the
same time a fresh alarm met him. Lady Constance
Spenser had contrived to withdraw the young Earl of
March from Windsor, and to fly with him. She was
shortly captured, and the young Prince brought back, but it was plain
that the danger was great.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Renewed
activity of
Northumberland,
Scrope and
Mowbray.</div>

<p>In April the King went against Wales. His absence in that direction
was at once taken advantage of by his northern enemies. The
difficulty with which he could secure supplies was one
of Henry’s main obstacles to success, and in the last
Parliament the opposition had been headed by Sir
Thomas Bardolph. That gentleman now appeared in
close conjunction with Northumberland, assisting him to garrison his
fortresses. At the same time Mowbray, the son of that Duke of Norfolk
with whom Henry had quarrelled at the time of his banishment,
and Scrope, the Archbishop of York, the brother of that Lord Scrope
who had been Richard’s chancellor at the beginning of his reign, and
whom that King had been forced to remove, joined the insurrection.
The Earl of Westmoreland, who remained constantly faithful to
Henry, was sent against them while Henry was engaged in Wales.
Again, the royal army was too strong for the insurgents. Scrope and
Mowbray were induced to disband their forces, and were then
immediately apprehended. Gascoigne, the chief justice, was called
upon to try them and convict them summarily. He was one of those
constitutional lawyers who were gradually rising in England, and he
refused to do so, pointing out that he should infringe the liberties
both of the Church and the House of Lords. Henry found in Sir
William Fulthorpe a more complacent judge. They were both
beheaded, not without arousing, as Gascoigne had foreseen, the anger
of the Lords. Upon the capture of his confederates, Northumberland
fled with Bardolph to Scotland, but being refused an interview with
the impostor, and mistrusting the honesty of Albany, he subsequently
withdrew to Wales. It was there alone that the war continued, nor
was it finally suppressed during the reign.</p>

</div>

<p>But, in the next two years, events occurred which at length placed
Henry in a position of security. The friends of the
Scotch King, fearing the ambition of Albany, which had
already induced him to take the life of the Duke of
Rothesay, the heir-apparent, determined to withdraw James, the
King’s second son and heir-apparent, from danger. He therefore took
ship for France, but on the way was captured by English
cruisers, and brought a prisoner to Henry, who grimly
remarked that they might as well have sent him direct
to him, as he could have taught him French quite well. He justified
this boast; for though he kept the young Prince prisoner, he gave him
an education which, upon his subsequent release, well fitted him for
the throne he occupied. Henry had now in his hands pledges of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
safety from all his enemies. The Earl of March was still with him;
Murdoch of Fife, Albany’s son, served as a hostage for his father;
while James served as security from all attacks from the royalist
party in Scotland. The following year (1407) was still more
fortunate. The overweening vanity of Orleans, his licentiousness,
which, it is said, did not even spare the young Duchess of Burgundy,
excited the anger of the Duke of Burgundy, the King’s
cousin, to such a degree, that he caused the Duke of
Orleans to be murdered in the streets of Paris. Henry’s
chief enemy in France was thus removed. With Burgundy, who had
lately inherited Flanders, and thus become the Prince of a trading
nation and the champion of the city populations, he had much in
common; and though he did not espouse his cause in any active
manner, he felt secure from any immediate danger. Without his
French allies, Owen Glendower was gradually driven back to the
mountains of North Wales, and in despair, Northumberland
and Bardolph again appeared in the North, took
arms, and were defeated and killed at Bramham. Thus
safe on the side of France, with Scotland pledged to peace by the
captivity of its princes, the Percies finally defeated,
and Owen Glendower confined to the limits of the purely
Celtic part of Wales, Henry was at length triumphant.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">His enforced
respect for the
Commons.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Climax of
their power.
1407.</div>
</div>

<p>During the whole of these years of difficulty, the King had found
it necessary to keep the Commons in good temper. Although he
suffered from constant want of money, and in vain tried to induce his
frequent Parliaments to act liberally towards him, he
seems on no occasion to have employed illegal means for
improving his position. It had become an accepted
axiom, that consent of all the estates of the realm was necessary for
the levying of taxes; and the Commons had made their position so
good, that, in the very year of his final triumph, they ventured upon
a quarrel with the Lords, claiming for themselves the exclusive right
of originating grants, and insisting on the absence of the King while
they were discussed. More than that, they had attempted, though
unsuccessfully, to oblige the King to answer their petition of
grievances before they made their grant, and succeeded in establishing
the custom of appropriating their grants to special objects, and of
paying them into the hands of treasurers of their own appointment.
But their increase of power was chiefly visible in their interference
with the royal expenditure and administration. In the fifth year of
his reign, the King had been obliged to displace four of his ministers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
at the request of the Commons, to declare his intention of governing
economically according to law, and to name his Privy Council in
Parliament. And in the eighth year of his reign, when
already he seemed upon the point of triumphing over
his enemies, he was compelled to grant his assent to a
petition of the Commons, which put as strict limitations upon his
power as any to which Richard, even at the time of his greatest
depression, had submitted. He had to name sixteen counsellors, by
whose advice solely he was to be guided. His ordinary revenue was
to be wholly appropriated to his household and the payment of his
debts. No officer of the household was to hold his place for life or
for a fixed term. The council was to determine nothing which the
common law was capable of determining; and the elections of
knights were regulated. At the head of this council was put the
Prince of Wales.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Explained by
the King’s
failing health.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Renewed vigour
at end of reign.</div>
</div>

<p>It is difficult to understand how the King should submit to this
arrangement, which virtually established a strictly limited monarchy,
just at the moment of his success. It is perhaps explained
by his failing health. A disease had attacked
his face, which changed into a form of leprosy, and
during the remainder of his life he was subject to attacks of epilepsy.
It was not unnatural that he should wish to withdraw somewhat
from public affairs. Under these circumstances, it is not quite clear
how far he is to be credited with the remaining events of his reign.
But the prudence and state-craft exhibited in them, which could
hardly have been expected from so young a man as Prince Henry, and
the more vigorous opposition which he subsequently made to the
demands of the Commons, would seem to show that he was still
practically ruler. This restoration of vigour is marked by his
refusal, towards the close of his reign, to grant any
extension of the right of liberty of speech, and by the
humble tone adopted by the Parliament in the thirteenth year of his
reign, when he was entreated to declare that he was not offended, and
that he regarded them as his loyal subjects.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry’s foreign
policy.
Marriages.</div>

<p>Having secured his position at home, though not, as has been
seen, without some sacrifices, the King’s attention was chiefly
directed towards securing the permanence of his dynasty by foreign
matrimonial alliances, and to obtaining a strong position abroad by
interfering in French politics. His two sisters were
already respectively Queens of Castile and Portugal. He
had himself married, in 1403, a Princess of Navarre. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
a husband for his eldest daughter he procured Louis, Count Palatine,
the son and heir of Rupert, King of the Romans; while his younger
daughter married Eric, who had consolidated a great Scandinavian
monarchy in the North.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Policy in
France.
1410.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Success of his
policy.</div>
</div>

<p>In France he made his weight felt by alternately siding with one
or other of the great parties which divided that kingdom. His
natural connection would have been the Burgundians;
and he first attached himself so far to that party as to
send a considerable army to their assistance. A battle
fought near St. Cloud (1411), in which the Armagnacs (as the friends
of Orleans were now called) were worsted, for the time rendered the
Duke of Burgundy the master of France. Henry chose this opportunity
to change sides, and entered into an arrangement with the defeated
princes, by which he was secured the full possession of Guienne. He
intended at the same time to have led an army into France, and to
have imitated the career of Edward III. The national danger produced
a temporary friendship between the French parties, and Burgundy,
at a meeting held at Auxerre, succeeded in persuading the
Armagnacs to annul their arrangement with the English. Henry’s
health prevented him from leading the expedition, as he intended;
but an army, under the Duke of Clarence, his second son, laid waste
Maine and Touraine, and was only stopped by the payment of a
large sum of money. After this Clarence withdrew to complete the
conquest of Guienne. Thus, though unable to fulfil
his ambitious project of invasion, Henry had contrived to
make his position abroad very different from what it was at the
beginning of his reign, when the French could refuse him the royal
title, and paralyze his home policy by a threat of invasion.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Views of the

Church.</div>
</div>

<p>From one point of view, as a usurper founding a new dynasty, he
had now been quite successful. As a preserver of society, he probably
regarded himself as not less so. Though the son of John of
Gaunt, the favourer of Wicliffe, and not averse in his youth to the
doctrines of that teacher, he had seen that Lollardism pointed, not
only to ecclesiastical, but to political changes. From the beginning
of the reign he had determined that the preservation of
the Church in all its privileges and possessions was the
surest means of checking the rising democracy. He had therefore
been always its staunch supporter. In pursuance of this policy, in
the second year of his reign, he had given his assent to a persecuting
statute, formed, it seems probable, on the petition of the clergy,
without the participation of the Commons. This statute, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
known under the title of “De Hæretico comburendo,” forbade teaching
and preaching without the license of a bishop, to whom
also was given the right of condemning heretical
books and writings, while the State undertook to carry
out the bishop’s sentence. Should any person thus condemned continue
in his heresy, he was to be regarded as relapsed, and handed
over to the civil arm, to be publicly burned. The first victim of this
statute was William Sautré, at one time parish priest of Lynn, and
involved in the treason of Kent and Huntingdon. On his persisting
in the errors with which he was charged, the new law was carried
into effect. The persecution once begun did not cease without more
victims, and produced the effect, so common in cases of persecution,
of driving the Lollards into further extremes of fanaticism. The
germ of socialism which no doubt existed in the Lollard doctrine,
and which showed itself in the constant demand for the abolition of
the wealth of the clergy, alarmed the barons, and made them strong
supporters of orthodoxy. The Commons, on the other
hand, although they appear to have differed in feeling at
different parts of the reign, were on the whole willing
enough, while supporting orthodoxy of faith, to countenance the
secularization of Church property. Indeed, they went so far in this
direction, that in the year 1410, in answer to the reiterated request of
the King for a settled yearly subsidy for his life, they pointed out to
him the advisability of appropriating some of the ecclesiastical revenues,
which would be enough, they said, to supply him with 15
earls, 1500 knights, and 6200 men-at-arms for military service. They
begged also that those condemned for heresy might be withdrawn
from the bishop’s jurisdiction, and tried by secular courts.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<div class="sidenotex">Henry’s jealousy

of Wales.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Henry’s death.</div>
</div>

<p>The popularity of the Prince of Wales, his position as head of his
father’s Council, not unnaturally gave the King some
uneasiness in his last years. It seems not improbable
that, having been once put at the head of the Council,
he virtually performed many of the duties of the Government.
Documents are extant in which he seems to be regarded as the
King’s representative. Moreover, the course of events seems to show
certain changes of policy which can be explained in this way. It is
evident from his after policy, that he was much attached to the Burgundian
party in France. We may therefore credit him with the
assistance sent to them, which proved so useful to them at the
Battle of St. Cloud, especially as the force was commanded by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
friend, Sir John Oldcastle. The sudden change of foreign policy
coincides in time with the King’s altered tone in replying to the
petitions of the Commons. These changes may very probably mark
a determination on the part of the King to re-establish his authority,
too much weakened by the position and popularity of the Prince.
The stories of the Prince’s wild life in London are mentioned by
writers who are almost contemporary, yet do not seem to agree well
with what is certainly known of his industry in public business.
They, as well as the strange travesty of Oldcastle, a good soldier and
stern religious enthusiast, into Shakspeare’s jovial knight, Sir John
Falstaff, are perhaps based on the malicious view taken by the orthodox
of Oldcastle’s religious tendencies. It is well known that one of
the charges alleged against all enthusiastic religionists is immorality.
Prince Henry’s subsequent prosecution and punishment of Oldcastle
would be represented as the discharge of his old favourites. The
aspiring and dangerous character of the Prince, in the eyes of his
father, is represented by the story which describes him as having
taken the crown from his father’s bedside during one of his fits, and
placed it on his own head; and having answered to the remorseful
observations of the King as to the unjust manner in which he had
gained it, that he “was prepared to guard it against the world in
arms.” It is at all events certain that coolness existed between father
and son at the close of the reign. The French expedition was
intrusted, not to the Prince of Wales, but to the Duke of Clarence,
and for the last year and a half Prince Henry was removed from his
position as President of the Council. The disease which
had so long tormented Henry came to a fatal termination
on the 20th of March 1413.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fortunate
opening of
his reign.
1413.</div>

<p class="drop-cap">The position of Henry V. on coming to the throne contrasts
sharply with that of his predecessor. Henry IV., with disputed
title, and in the midst of excited passions of faction, in
which he had himself taken a prominent share, had to
work out for himself the establishment of his dynasty
and the restoration of political order. His son entered into the
fruits of his labour. He had but to continue his father’s policy. The
dynasty seemed secure, the apparatus of government was in good
working order, and the new King, already practised in the work of
government, brought with him that popularity which brilliant
qualities, a handsome person, and the vigour of youth, are sure to
secure. The painstaking prudence of the late King, overshadowed as
it was by his ill-health and gloomy character, was forgotten, and the
hopes of the nation were fixed upon the fortunate youth whose faults
as yet had been but those which are easily pardoned as the natural
wildness incident to his age.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General amnesty
and release of
prisoners.</div>

<p>The young King seemed to please himself with the idea that his
peaceful accession was to complete the healing of faction in the
country, and to begin a period of glory and happiness. He made but
few changes in the ministry of his father, but both Thomas Arundel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
the Archbishop, and Sir William Gascoigne were removed from their
offices. It is possible that they may have been the
advisers of the late King during that period when he
was at enmity with his son. Already, before his coronation,
of their own free will the nobles did him homage; and his
Parliament granted him without difficulty the tax on wool for four
years. To complete the general harmony, he published an amnesty,
dismissed many political prisoners, and the greater part of his Scottish
captives, and entered into negotiations for the liberty of the Scotch
King. He even went so far as to reinstate both the Earl of March,
the real claimant to the throne, and Henry Percy, son of Hotspur, his
father’s persistent enemy, in their property and position. The body
of Richard II. was removed from Langley, and honourably interred
in Westminster. The past was, as it were, to be forgotten, and Henry
would rule as the popular and accepted King of all parties.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Signs of
slumbering
discontent.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">The Lollards.
1414.</div>
</div>

<p>In the midst of this show of security and peace there were, however,
visible signs that his father’s work was not yet completed. The
royal favour shown to the Church and to the orthodox
party during the last reign, and the persecution which
had fallen upon heresy, had not by any means destroyed
the Lollards. The same policy had still to be pursued. The religious,
it might be called the bigoted, tendency of the house of Lancaster
was very strong in the young King. He had been one of the chief
petitioners against heresy in 1406, and had shared in and superintended
some of the religious executions; especially is mentioned that
of John Badby, in 1410. The Prince had interrupted this man’s
execution, and attempted the conversion of the half-burnt sufferer;
finding him firm, however, he allowed the execution to be completed.
This tendency induced him to enter into close alliance with the
Church, and throughout his reign to adopt the language of religious
enthusiasm, pretending to regard himself as the appointed instrument
of God’s vengeance on the sins of the French. He thus became the
willing agent of the clergy in completing their persecution of the
sectarians, and listened readily to the exaggerated reports
for which the conduct of the Lollards afforded some
ground. The head of this party was now Sir John Oldcastle, who
sat as a Peer in right of his wife under the title of Lord Cobham.
His castle of Cowling, in Kent, afforded shelter to their persecuted
teachers, while his high character and old friendship with the King
made his influence important. The Archbishop determined to attack
this man, at first pretending that he desired his conversion only. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
placed in Henry’s hands an heretical book which had been found in
an illuminator’s shop, and which belonged to Oldcastle. Henry tried
first of all to argue with Oldcastle (who, however, denied having read
the book), but could not convert him. The duties of friendship being
now fulfilled, the Church was allowed to take the matter in hand.
The heretic appeared several times before his judges, but firmly
refused to depart from his points, that the Pope was Antichrist, and
that in the Lord’s Supper, though the body of Christ might be present,
yet the bread was bread. This firmness produced the only possible
result, and he was condemned to be burnt; but in the interval
allowed him before the completion of his sentence, he managed
to escape.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>The attack upon their chief roused the Lollards, and they are said
to have entered into a general conspiracy for surprising and mastering
the King and his brothers at Eltham, during the festivities of Christmas.
Henry had early news of a meeting which was to be held on
the 7th of January 1414, in St. Giles’ Fields. It is quite unproved
how far the intentions of the conspirators really reached. Henry,
with the Church behind him, was ready to believe anything. He
feared, perhaps, an insurrection similar to Wat Tyler’s. Causing,
therefore, the gates of the city to be closed, he spread armed men
round the place of meeting, and as the Lollards approached, singly or
in small bodies, they were seized. The news that the King’s forces
were abroad soon spread, and prevented any great number from
falling into his hands. A jury was hastily summoned to declare that
Oldcastle had treasonable plans, and a price was set on his head.
The same jury then proceeded to try the thirty-nine prisoners, all of
whom were either hanged or burnt. This event was followed by a
still stricter proscription of heretical preachers and books. Chicheley,
who succeeded Arundel as Archbishop this year, followed in his
predecessor’s steps, and a statute was passed by which all judges and
municipal authorities were bidden to apprehend and try Lollards,
while conviction of heresy entailed confiscation of goods.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry’s reasons
for the impolitic
French war.</div>

<p>Henry prided himself on having won his first victory in the cause
of the Church; but his naturally ambitious character
led him to desire triumphs of another kind. It seems
indeed as if a strange combination of motives impelled
him to take the false step which gave the character to his reign, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
plunged the country into a lengthy and ultimately disastrous war
with France. His father is said to have urged him, with mistaken
worldly wisdom, to withdraw the minds of his subjects from dangerous
topics by filling them with thoughts of military glory. The Church,
frightened by the suggestions of confiscation in the last reign, urged
him to pursue the same course. The natural but mistaken admiration
for military glory induced him to listen readily to their advice,
while the wickedness and misery exhibited by the French nation at once
afforded him an admirable opportunity, and may have suggested to
his fanatical mind, that it was his duty to punish such vice, and to
reduce such turbulence into order. Experience proved, as it often
has proved, the mistake, nay, the wickedness, of averting domestic
dangers by the wanton pursuit of warlike success. Meanwhile, at first,
and during the whole of this King’s short life, the step seemed perfectly
successful. The reign, as a period of English history, is almost devoid
of interest. The attention of the nation was centred in a French war.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Expulsion of the
Burgundians
from Paris.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Attempt at
national
government.</div>
</div>

<p>Since the Duke of Clarence had secured Guienne the state of
France had become only more deplorable. The Treaty of Auxerre
produced no real union between the factions. There was a certain
show of national action under the pressure of a threatened invasion
from England; the King and the Great Council of France sat in
Paris; the States General were summoned, and under the influence of
the University certain reforms introduced. But the death of Henry
IV. prevented for the time all danger of invasion; and the cause of
union being removed, the factions again separated. The Duke de
Guienne, the French King’s eldest son, and representative of the
crown during his father’s fits of madness, was devoted to the wildest
licentiousness, and disliked his gloomy father-in-law, John of
Burgundy. He began to intrigue for the restoration of the Orleanist
Princes. The ruffianly populace of Paris, headed by the guild of
butchers, and led by Caboche, a skinner, were devotedly
attached to the Burgundians. A fierce and murderous
uproar arose; but its violence was such, that the better
class of citizens were aroused, expelled the Cabochiens, who fled to
the Duke of Burgundy, and readmitted the Armagnacs, as the Orleanists
were now called. The counter-revolution was complete, the Armagnacs
got possession of the government, attacked the Burgundian Duke, and
drove him before them, till they were checked at Arras. A temporary
truce was then patched up; but the Duke of Guienne
soon after contrived for a moment to banish both parties
from the capital, and to establish a sort of national
government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry’s double
diplomacy and
outrageous
claims.</div>

<p>It was at this time that Henry V. began to meddle in French
affairs. Already, during the retreat to Arras, Burgundy had opened
negotiations with him, and these, in his anger against the Duke of
Guienne, he now pressed still more warmly. Meanwhile, Henry
negotiated also with the central authority in Paris. By this double
negotiation, which included a plan for the marriage of Henry, on the
one hand, with Catherine of France, and on the other,
with Catherine of Burgundy, Henry made Burgundy
neutral, while he pressed claims on the unfortunate
French monarch of so outrageous a description, that he must have intended
by securing their rejection to give himself a plausible ground
for war. His first demand was nothing less than the cession of the
whole French monarchy. When this was refused, his ambassadors
restricted their demand to all the countries ceded to Edward III. by
the Peace of Brétigny, as well as Normandy, the coast of Picardy,
Anjou, Maine and Touraine, the suzerainty of Brittany and Flanders,
1,600,000 crowns, as the residue of King John’s ransom, with the
hand of the Princess Catherine, and a dowry of 2,000,000 crowns.
The Duke of Berri, the King’s uncle, was at that time the chief
member of the government. He naturally refused Henry’s enormous
demands, but offered all the districts of Aquitaine to the south of the
Charente, and 600,000 crowns as dowry for the Princess.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His preparations.</div>

<p>All this while, Henry continued his preparations, raised troops,
borrowed ships from Holland and Zeeland, and summoned
in April a great council of Peers.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> He there
declared his intention of seeking his rights in France, appointed his
brother John, Duke of Bedford, Lieutenant of the kingdom, and fixed
the conditions of the contracts which he made with nobles for supplying
him with soldiers.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> He arranged also the manner in which the
spoil was to be divided, and other details for the supply of the army.
The devotion of the Church was to supply him with the means of
meeting these vast expenses. Archbishop Chicheley and the Churchmen,
fearing, no doubt, the democratic tendencies of the Commons,
were willing to make some sacrifice. They agreed that no foreigners
should hold benefices, and thus allowed the King to use the incomes
of all the priories of the foreign orders of the kingdom to the number
of 122. The proceeds of this transaction, increased by loans from
foreigners, the pawning of his jewels, and the pledging of the tax on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
wool, supplied him with finances. An embassy from France, with
still larger offers, including Limousin, and a dowry of 800,000 crowns,
produced no improvement in the relations between the two countries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He lands in
France.
1415.</div>

<p>Before Charles VI. could reply to the despatch of his ambassador,
announcing the rejection of these terms, on the 3rd of
August, the English army, of about 6000 men-at-arms
and 24,000 archers, was already embarked. On the 14th
of August it landed at the mouth of the Seine, where Havre de Grace
now is. No steps were taken to prevent the disembarkation. The
kingdom was in a state of fearful misery and disorder. The conduct
of the war was given to the Armagnacs, Charles d’Albret was
appointed constable; the Duke of Burgundy therefore held aloof,
and the English had, in fact, only one half of the country against
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conspiracy of
Cambridge.</div>

<p>An event had occurred before the English embarkation which, by
proving to the King that his position was not so secure as he thought,
may have made him still more determined in his present course. He
was engaged at Southampton preparing his expedition,
when a conspiracy was discovered, in which the King’s
cousin Richard, brother of the Duke of York, and lately created
Earl of Cambridge, and one of his most trusted counsellors, Henry
Scrope of Masham, were implicated. They were accused of an
intention to take Edmund, Earl of March, with them into Wales, to
crown him there, and declare him rightful King, if Richard were
really dead. They had also summoned from Scotland Thomas of
Trumpington, the false Richard. The Earl of Cambridge had
married Ann of Mortimer, the sister of the Earl of March. We
have here the beginning of that close union between the supporters of
the legitimate line and the House of York, which again appears in
the Wars of the Roses. Cambridge and Scrope were both executed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Capture of
Harfleur.</div>

<p>The first place to be attacked was Harfleur; it was bravely
defended by the garrison under the Sire d’Estouteville.
The inhabitants were told by the Court to take courage
and trust to the King, but no help was sent them, though 14,000 or
15,000 men were within reach. On the 22nd of September they
were compelled to capitulate. The conquered town was treated as
Calais had been; the wealthier inhabitants were put to ransom, the
goods seized, the people given their choice of leaving the city or
becoming English. But this success had been hardly earned, the
losses both by sickness and in fighting had been great. A large
number of invalids had to be sent back to England. With little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
more than half his army Henry could venture no further into France.
He determined to march along the coast to Calais. The strictest
discipline was maintained in the little band, and the King strove to
foster in it a religious and enthusiastic spirit; pillage was punished
with death; rations only were demanded from the inhabitants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry compelled
to retire upon
Calais.</div>

<p>Henry had intended to cross the Somme at Blanchetaque, where
Edward III. had passed it. False information was
brought him that the ford was guarded. In reality, the
feudal army was as yet only collecting near Abbeville,
around the standard of the Constable d’Albret, a man but little fitted
for his post. Had Henry passed at once he might have reached Calais
without a great battle; as it was, he was compelled to follow the river
upwards, and time was afforded to the French to collect their forces,
and seek their own destruction in a pitched battle. Henry sought
a ford across the river for a long time in vain. He passed Amiens,
and had got within a league of Ham, in a very dangerous position
among the strong fortresses of Ham, St. Quentin and Péronne, when
at length a ford was discovered near Béthancourt. The Constable,
who was at Péronne, might have destroyed him in the passage. He
let him pass unmolested. Following feudal fashion, he sent to
ask Henry to name a day and place for the battle; but whatever
external chivalry may have been visible in Henry, his military
character was that of a hard, practical, modern soldier. He answered
that there was no need to name day or place, as he was always to be
found in the open fields. For four days the armies followed almost
parallel lines of march, the French making no use of their superiority
in numbers to disturb the quiet advance of the English, although they
spread nightly among the villages for shelter. At length the Constable,
with singular want of prudence, took up his position a little to the
north of Hesdin and Cressy, on a small confined plain, where his
large army, of at least 50,000 fighting men, was jammed in between
two woods. This force consisted almost entirely of nobles and their
feudal followers, who in their foolish pride of class had rejected the
assistance of the infantry of the towns. The ground was arable
land, and the soil deep and heavy, so that the heavy armed French
in their splendid harness sank deep at every step, while the English,
clad mostly in leather jerkins, and many of them barefoot, moved
with comparative ease. The night, we are told, was passed in riot
by the French; in sober preparation or religious exercise by the
English.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of
Agincourt.
Oct. 25, 1415.</div>

<p>The French drew themselves up in three massive lines or battles;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a><br /><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the two first dismounted and fought on foot, for which their heavy
armour but little fitted them; the third line retained
their horses, as did two small wings intended to crush
the archers. The state of the soil obliged them to
adopt a defensive method of fighting quite contrary to their habits.
The English advanced upon them&mdash;the archers in front, the
heavy-armed infantry behind, the mixed archers and infantry on
the flanks. They are described as having a miserable, ragged appearance
after their weary march, as contrasted with the splendour of the
French. Henry rode among them, cheering them with the memories
of bygone victories. He had previously ordered every archer to
supply himself with a stake sharpened at each end, which he was to
plant before him, and thus make a moveable palisade. At eleven
o’clock, after a brief and useless parley between the armies, Sir
Thomas Erpingham, the English Marshal of the Host, tossed up his
baton with the cry “Now strike,” and the battle began. The English
advanced a few steps, expecting a charge from the enemy, but the
hostile ranks remained immoveable; they were, in fact, planted knee-deep
in the mud, and afforded a fine aim for the English archers, who
did not spare them. At length, putting their heads down to avoid as
much as possible the fatal arrows, the first line came heavily on, and
the mounted wings began to close round the English; but the stakes
of the archers served them in good stead. Of the horses, a large proportion
tripped and fell in the rough ploughed land; not one in ten
of their riders, we are told, came hand to hand with the archers.
Unsupported and almost immoveable, the infantry broke. The
archers seeing their plight, issued from between their stakes, threw
down bow and arrow, seized their axes and maces, and fell headlong
upon them. “It seemed,” says the chronicler, “as though they were
hammering upon anvils.” The men-at-arms fell beneath the furious
charge, and were smothered by their own companions as they fell over
them. The same fate awaited the second line. The English men-at-arms
had come up to support the archers, and the battle was fiercer,
and for a time more equal. Certain of the French knights, under the
Duke of Alençon, swore to take the life of Henry, and did their best
to keep their oath. One of them cleft in two the golden crown on the
helmet worn by Henry, and Alençon killed his cousin, the Duke of
York, at his side. It was in vain; the English steadily advanced;
the defeat of the first line, the rush of the fugitives, disordered and
confused the cavalry, and they turned and fled. The English were
already masters of the field, when news was brought that a fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
enemy was in their rear, and flames were seen arising from the village
of Maisoncelle behind them. Henry, afraid of this new attack, and of
a rally of the fugitives, gave the terrible order that all the prisoners
should be killed. When his troops hesitated, he told off 200 archers
to do the work; and already very many had been killed in cold
blood, when the discovery that the alarm was a false one induced
Henry to revoke his order. Of the 10,000 Frenchmen who
died 8000 were of noble blood; among them were the Dukes
of Alençon, Brabant, and Bar, the Constable d’Albret, and all the
chief officers of the army. The Dukes of Orleans and Bourbon, the
Counts of Vendôme and Richemont, and Marshal Boucicaut, with
15,000 knights, remained prisoners. Besides the Duke of York
and the Earl of Oxford, the English had lost 1600 men. The King,
with his triumphant army, at once proceeded to Calais, and thence to
England. He attributed his wonderful success to Heaven, whose
instrument he was in punishing the crimes in France. “Never,”
said he to the Duke of Orleans, “was greater disorganization or licentiousness,

<div class="sidenote">The French
Government
falls into the
hands of the
Armagnacs.</div>

<p>The destruction of princes and feudal nobles at Agincourt seems to
have annihilated the Armagnac party. The hatred of
the Dauphin for the Duke of Burgundy prevented the
unity which such an event might have produced. He
summoned Bernard of Armagnac from the south of
France, where he then was, and gave himself completely into his
hands, making him Constable, Governor-General of the finances, and
Captain of all the fortresses of France.</p>

<p>The party of the Constable, which had once been that of most of
the princes of the royal blood, consisted now of adventurers, pledged
to continue a civil war, to which they owed their importance. The
real governors of France and Paris were the Gascon noble D’Armagnac
and the Breton Tannegui Duchâtel. Their tyranny was of the bitterest
description; their hired men-at-arms did all the harm an undisciplined
soldiery can do; the people were taxed, in the midst of bitter
famine, to the last farthing; their bloody tyranny induced them to
forbid bathing in the Seine, lest the bathers should find there the
corpses of their victims. The sole virtue of the party was that they
continued the war with England, while Burgundy renewed his treaty
with that nation. The Constable’s efforts were not successful. An
attempt to regain Harfleur was defeated by the Duke of Bedford.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
But Henry for the present was content to stand on the defensive.
The Parliament, in its enthusiasm at his great success, had granted
him large subsidies, and the tax on wool for life; and he was spending
his time in recruiting the strength of his army, and in giving a
magnificent reception to Sigismund, King of the Romans.</p>

</div>

<p>That Prince had succeeded in re-establishing the obsolete supremacy
of the head of the Roman Empire. This he had
done by the activity and success with which he collected
a general council of the Church at Constance. His
object at the council was to heal the great schism, which
since 1378 had divided the Church. On the death of Gregory XI.,
who had brought back the Papacy to Rome, after its seventy years’
servitude to the French at Avignon, a double election took place, and
the world was divided between Urbanists, who owned Urban VI.,
the Roman Pontiff, and the Clementines, who acknowledged Clement
VII. of Avignon. Each Pope had his successors, and an attempted
compromise at Pisa in 1409 had produced a third Pope. The three
claimants to the honour were now Gregory XII. at Rome, Benedict
XIII. at Avignon, John XXIII. at Pisa. The new council declared
itself superior to all Popes, and proceeded to secure the dismissal or
resignation of these three prelates. It also undertook to suppress the
Wicliffite heresy, which had spread to Bohemia. Its efforts in this
direction led to the condemnation and burning of John Huss and
Jerome of Prague. The negotiations with Pope Benedict, who was
acknowledged in Spain, were intrusted to Sigismund, who thus not
unreasonably thought himself the arbiter of Europe, and determined
to add to his ecclesiastical successes the healing of the war between
France and England. For this purpose he passed through Paris, but
met with indifferent success, and then betook himself to England.
With Henry, as suppresser of heresy and champion of
the Church, he had much in common, and he soon laid
aside his position of arbiter to become an English partisan.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> One
incident of his visit is interesting, as marking both his position and
the determined independence of the English. While in Paris he was
present at a trial, and one party to the dispute seemed on the point
of losing his case because he was not of knightly rank. Sigismund
immediately knighted him. This interference was not pleasant to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
the French, and gave rise to the idea that the Emperor was claiming
universal supremacy. On his approach to England, therefore, one of
the King’s brothers and some other lords rode out into the water by
the side of the ship, and there made him solemnly assert that he
came as a friend, and claimed no jurisdiction in England.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Henry’s second
invasion.</div>
</div>

<p>Sigismund’s efforts at procuring peace had been thwarted in Paris
by the determination of D’Armagnac, whose position had
become apparently more assured than ever. One after
the other, Charles VI.’s two elder sons died, and his
third son, Charles, who had been brought up by the Armagnac party,
was now Dauphin. Besides the Constable, there was no one but his
mother who had influence over him. That influence Bernard was
determined to destroy. The avaricious character and
licentiousness of the Queen afforded easy opportunity.
He drove her into privacy at Tours, and seized her
money. Henceforward she hated the Dauphin heartily, and was
ready to do anything to injure him. Thus, when Burgundy
approached Paris with an army, he was suddenly summoned to
rescue the Queen from her captivity, and France became still more
distinctly divided into the party of the Dauphin and the party of
the Queen. Still further to complete the separation,
and to give a shadow of legitimacy to their action, the
Queen and Burgundy established a counter-Parliament
at Amiens, and a rival Great Council of France. The civil war went
on increasing in atrocity, and D’Armagnac was too hard pressed to
interfere with Henry, who, on August 14th, landed at
Honfleur for his second invasion, and proceeded to
master Normandy. With Flanders, Artois and Picardy on the one
hand rendered neutral by the friendship of Burgundy, and Brittany
on the other under a truce with him, he could act at his ease. Caen,
Bayeux, L’Aigle, were captured one after the other, and the next year,
with four divisions spreading from Artois to Brittany, he pushed
southward, conquering all the strong towns as he went. He was not
a merciful conqueror. He exacted to the full the rights of war.
Most of the towns were treated as Harfleur had been, but in nearly
every case a certain number of the citizens were beheaded under the
title of rebels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Parisians,

<p>It was impossible for the French parties, savage as they were,
to look on calmly at the English successes; a great
attempt at reconciliation was made, but again the obstinacy
of the Constable brought it to nothing. The idea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
the cessation of the civil war had filled the Parisians with hope.
The failure of that hope was more than they could bear. The keys
of the gates were secured, and L’Ile-Adam, who commanded one of
the garrisons which the Burgundians had pushed close to Paris, was
admitted within the walls. The people rose in thousands upon their
hated tyrants. Tannegui Duchâtel succeeded in saving the young
Dauphin, and retired with him to Melun. Meanwhile, the prisons
were crowded with captive Armagnacs, and a few days afterwards
the passions of the extreme Burgundian partisans broke loose. The
Cabochiens, who had lived as exiles in Burgundy, and returned with
the Duke, again made their appearance. A fearful massacre took
place at all the prisons; among the number slain was the Constable
himself. From this time onward, the Armagnacs were spoken of as
the Dauphinois; their leading spirit was Duchâtel, who followed
closely in the footsteps of the late D’Armagnac. He would hear
of no peace with Burgundy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fall of Rouen.
Jan. 15, 1419.</div>

<p>Yet that peace was terribly wanted, for Henry had now laid siege
to Rouen, the capital of Normandy. The defence was
in the highest degree gallant. Promises were given by
Burgundy that help should be sent, but none came. At length a
part of the garrison determined to cut their way through. When a
portion of them had already crossed the bridge, it broke with the
remainder, and the attempt had to be given up. Men charged Guy
Bouteiller, the governor, and not unreasonably, with treacherously
sawing the supports. At length all hope, unless succour arrived, was
gone. Every eatable thing had been devoured. Hundreds of useless
mouths had been driven without the walls, and not being allowed to
pass the English lines, lay starving in the ditches. The extent of
charity the garrison could afford to show, was to draw the new-born
babes up the walls in baskets, to have them baptized, and then
return them to their mothers to starve. Driven to extremities, the
garrison sent deputies demanding assistance from the King, and
threatening if it did not come to become his fiercest enemies. They
were bidden to wait till the fourth day after Christmas. In spite of
their miserable plight, they resolved to wait the fortnight that was
left. On that day there arrived, not assistance, but a message from
the Duke of Burgundy to make what terms they could with the
King of England. They asked what those terms would be. He
bade them surrender at discretion. But they knew his character too
well to trust to his mercy, and resolved to fire the town and make
their way out as they could. This threat brought Henry to reason,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
and for a ransom of 300,000 crowns he gave them the same sort of terms
as he usually did. Seven men were excepted from pardon; of these
all but one were ransomed. That one, Alain Blanchart, the King,
ever unable to appreciate bravery in an enemy, caused to be beheaded.</p>

</div>

<p>At length it seemed as though the French factions had come to an
understanding; the cry of the whole nation was too
strong to resist. A truce was made between the parties
for three months, and the Duke of Burgundy, with the Queen and
the King, who had been in their custody since the recapture of Paris,
met Henry at Meulan, and attempted to come to terms. But Henry
still demanded more than it was possible to grant. Burgundy therefore
withdrew in anger, and at Pouilli-le-Fort held a personal meeting
with the Dauphin, and apparently came to terms with
him. The show of friendship was only hollow. Shortly
after, at the instigation of Duchâtel, a second meeting
was demanded at Montereau sur Yonne. It was nothing but an
ambush. The meeting was to be held on the bridge, and barricades
were to keep back all but ten partisans of either side; but no sooner
was the Duke with two followers within the barrier than Tannegui
Duchâtel shut the door on that side, while from the
other end the Dauphinois crowded in. The Duke was
there murdered, and of his following one man alone escaped.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Young Burgundy
joins England.
Treaty of Troyes,
1420.</div>

<p>The effect of this murder was instantaneous. The son of Jean sans
peur, Philip, Count of Charolais, at once put himself at the head of his
party, and forgetting everything but revenge, opened
negotiations with the English. On October 17th, the
plenipotentiaries met at Arras, and the preliminaries of
the treaty were drawn up; by which Henry was to marry Catherine
of France, and to be recognised as heir after the death of the reigning
king. Meanwhile he was to have the administration of the country.
All the exchange asked was, that he would make no peace with the
Dauphin, and join in carrying on war with that Prince. These preliminaries
were to be ratified by the King, the Queen, and States
General. The King’s imbecility prevented any opposition from him,
and the Queen was only too glad of an opportunity of disinheriting
her son; she calculated that at least her daughter Catherine, whom
she loved dearly, would enjoy the crown. An unexpected consequence
followed this treaty, which was completed at Troyes. This
was the resurrection of the party of the Dauphin, which henceforward
became the national party. Henry was at once called upon
to give vigorous assistance, and found occupation for all his army at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
the siege of Melun, which was defended with extreme courage. But
in December he found an opportunity of making a triumphal entry
into Paris, where his stern and haughty manner, and “his words
which cut like razors,” won him but little favour; and thence he
passed to England to meet a magnificent reception with his wife.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">English defeat
at Beaugé.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Henry hurries
to Paris.</div>
</div>

<p>He there heard bad news. One of the signs of the renewed activity
of his enemies had been a treaty with Castile, and the employment
of the Castilian fleet. Already, in the preceding year, the Spanish
fleet had defeated the English, and then proceeding to Scotland, had
returned with a reinforcement of some 4000 men under the Earl of
Buchan and Lord Stewart of Darnley. Strengthened with these
troops, the Dauphin’s party had attacked the English in the west.
Clarence, the King’s brother, who had been left in charge of the
kingdom, advanced to meet them. The armies encountered at
Beaugé in Anjou, and there, forgetting the national tactics, and
neglecting the use of the archers, they suffered a complete
defeat, in which the King’s brother was killed. It
was the first reverse the English arms had met with, and Henry well
understood the moral effect it might have. He hastened at once to
France, and leaving alone for the present the disaffection which was
showing itself in Picardy, went direct to Paris to re-establish
his prestige. Thence he marched to the attack
of Meaux, whence an Armagnac garrison was pillaging the country
to the very gates of Paris. It was under the command of the Bastard
of Vaurus, a savage soldier, who delighted to hang his prisoners by
dozens on the branches of a large elm outside his town. The bravery
of his defence equalled his barbarity. It was not without the greatest
efforts that the town and castle, called the Marché, were reduced.</p>

</div>

<p>Meanwhile the war had broken out again in Burgundy, and Henry
was summoned to the support of his allies at the siege of Cosne. He
would not send help, he said, but would come at the head of his
whole army. The boast was a vain one. His army, indeed, set out
under the command of the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Warwick,
but the King’s health, which had been failing for the last two years,
quite broke down, and the generals were hastily recalled
to be present at the deathbed of their sovereign, who
died on the 31st of August 1422. Conscious of his
approaching end, he had made dispositions to meet it; he had laid
special stress on the continuation of the treaty with Burgundy; had
begged Bedford never to make peace under less advantageous terms
than the entire cession of Normandy; had intrusted the regency of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
France to the same brother should the Duke of Burgundy decline it;
put England into the hands of Gloucester; and intrusted the education
of his infant son to Warwick. He then died amid all those
signs of religious enthusiasm which had marked his life, declaring
that he had intended to lead a crusade to Jerusalem, and covering all
remorse, which his cruel war might well have excited, by the thought
that he had acted with the approbation of those most holy men the
English bishops. Stern, haughty, an unpitying soldier, he had yet
by his exhibition of firm justice and love of order gained the admiration
and respect, if not the love, of his new subjects; and Englishmen
forgot his reactionary policy, and misjudged the want of wisdom
in his foreign undertakings, amid the enthusiasm his successful career
excited. Very shortly after his conqueror, the old King
Charles VI. also died, and his son Charles became the
representative of the French monarchy. He caused himself to be
at once crowned at Poitiers; but the English failed to recognise his
title, and spoke of him as the Dauphin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrangements
of the kingdom.
1422.</div>

<p class="drop-cap">By the fiction of the English constitution, England was now
governed by a child of nine months old. The late King had
thoughtfully arranged for the government by the nomination
of Gloucester to the regency in England, Bedford
to the regency in France; but experience of former
regencies, and the constant adherence to constitutional forms which
marked the English nobility, led the Privy Council to make different
arrangements. It was determined, in fact, that the Council should be
virtually the governing body. This was in accordance with several
precedents; even as late as the reign of Henry IV., a council named
in Parliament had, during the last years of that monarch’s life,
governed England. When the hero, whose popularity and ability
had for a time carried all men with him, was dead, it was natural that
the kingdom should fall back into the same system of government.
In the first Parliament therefore, by the advice of the Council,
Bedford was made Regent of both France and England, while to
Gloucester was given the title of Defender or Protector of the kingdom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
which amounted to little more than the position of President of the
Council, by whose advice he was bound to act, and of which the
members were nominated in Parliament. After this, the grant of the
wool tax and of tonnage and poundage, for two years, closed the session.</p>

</div>

<p>All interests were still centred in France. To all appearance, both
in geographical position and in the talents of their
leader, the advantage lay with the English. Bedford
shared all the better qualities of his elder brother; as
able, both as a general and a statesman, he was of a gentler and a
finer character; on the other hand, the Dauphin Charles was a man
without vigour, sunk in sensual pleasure, and still under the influence
of unprincipled adventurers. His possessions, too, were much
restricted. He found himself confined to the centre and south-east of
France. It was only from south of the Loire to Languedoc that his
power was unquestioned. Either England or its great ally Burgundy
possessed or dominated all other parts of France; while Savoy and
Brittany, at the extreme and opposite corners, were professedly
neutral. The strength of this position, such as it was, lay in its
central situation. The immense extent of country the English held
required resources beyond the power of that country single-handed to
produce; by alliance with Burgundy alone was it possible. But
misgovernment and party feeling prevented any great exhibition of
strength on the part of France. She had to rely chiefly on mercenaries,
and the war was merely kept alive. In 1423, Bedford
succeeded in forming anew a close alliance with Burgundy, in which
Brittany also joined. It was cemented by a double marriage; on
the one hand, Bedford married Anne, Philip’s sister,
while Arthur of Richemont, the brother of the Duke
of Brittany, married her elder sister Margaret.</p>

</div>

<p>The treaty was scarcely finished when Bedford had to move southward
to relieve Crévant on the Yonne, closely besieged by the Scotch
and French. The expedition was very successful. A simultaneous
attack from the city and the relieving army destroyed the besiegers;
1200 knights, chiefly Scotch, were said to have been left on the field.
But fresh recruits were continually coming to the French, some from
Italy, some from Scotland; notably 5,000 men under Archibald
Douglas, who was raised to the Duchy of Touraine; while Stewart of
Darnley, their former leader, received the lordships of Aubigné and
of Dreux. Bedford attempted to cut off this source of
help by arranging for the release of the Scottish King,
who had now been twenty-four years a captive in England. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
September 1423, his freedom was arranged, on the payment of £40,000
for his past expenses, and upon a promise on his part that he would
keep peace with England, and marry an English lady. He was told
to choose his own wife, as English ladies were not in the habit of proposing
for husbands, and married Joan Beaufort, daughter of the Earl
of Somerset, granddaughter of John of Gaunt. He did his best,
though not always successfully, to keep his promise of
peace. But this step on the part of Bedford did not stop
the Scotch in France. They pushed on even to the borders of
Normandy, and captured Ivry. Bedford addressed himself to the
recovery of that fortress. 18,000 troops, Scotch, French, and Italians,
led by the Duke of Alençon and Earl of Buchan, now Constable of
France, marched to relieve it. This they were unable to do, but
revenged themselves by the capture of the neighbouring
town of Verneuil. Thither the Regent pursued them,
and there he brought them to action. It was the old
story over again. The French had not yet learnt wisdom by
experience; and again the mass of heavy-armed foot, with cavalry on
the flanks, was shattered by the English archers from behind their
impenetrable wall of pointed stakes. The Scotch auxiliaries were
nearly destroyed; and among the 5000 dead were
the Earls of Douglas, Buchan and Aumale. The victory
was likened in Parliament to the Battle of Agincourt.
Its effects were almost as complete. For the time the French had to
withdraw completely behind the Loire.</p>

</div>

<p>It was the unbridled folly of Gloucester which disturbed the
favourable position which Bedford had secured. The Countess
Jacqueline of Hainault and Holland had married John of Brabant,
and had fled from her husband. She had taken refuge in England,
and just before the death of Henry V., Gloucester, during the life of
her former husband, had taken her for his wife. The
Duke of Burgundy was the cousin and close ally of
John of Brabant, and had hoped to bring all the Netherlands
under his power by his kinsman’s marriage
with Jacqueline. Gloucester would hear of no compromise,
but, in 1424, appeared with 5000 English troops in Calais,
and took possession of Hainault. Philip of Burgundy at once
wavered in his friendship for England, drew closer his connection
with Brabant, and even procured a truce with the Dauphin. Preparations
for a duel, to which he had challenged Burgundy, called
Gloucester home. The immediate effect of his departure was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
occupation of Hainault by John of Brabant. Jacqueline herself was
taken prisoner, but managing to escape in man’s clothes, she reached
her other dominions in Holland, and thence proceeded to begin a war
with Burgundy. Her English lover could send her but little help, and
at last, after her husband’s death in 1428, she surrendered to Philip,
and declared him her heir. Gloucester’s infidelity broke off relations
between them, and eventually, in 1436, the whole of the Netherlands
came into the power of Burgundy. It has been said that, without
the friendship of Burgundy, the English resources were insufficient to
retain France. This was the first shock that friendship received.</p>

Gloucester.</div>

</div>

<p>This outbreak of Gloucester’s was but one instance of his intemperate
and ambitious character. At home, he had already involved
the government in difficulties, by his constant rivalry with
Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester, second son of John of Gaunt
by Catherine Swinford. This Prince had already been engaged in all
the prominent affairs of the last reign. But though
a man of vast wealth and large ambition, his
aspirations in England were rather for his family
than for himself; and in the financial difficulties which began
to beset England his money was freely advanced without interest
to Government. In 1424, he had been made Chancellor, for
the express purpose of counterbalancing the power of his nephew
Gloucester, and in pursuance of this object, he had, during
Gloucester’s absence in Hainault, garrisoned the Tower, from
which Gloucester on his return found himself excluded. This
produced an open quarrel and an appeal to arms, only repressed
by the intervention of the Prince of Portugal, at that time in England.
There was one man only who could decide this quarrel, and that was
the Duke of Bedford, who on coming to England would at once
become the constitutional Regent. He found it therefore necessary to
leave France, where he was much wanted, and to return to England.
He contrived to bring about a reconciliation, at a Parliament held at
Leicester. The Bishop of Winchester, from patriotic motives, resigned
his chancellorship, and got leave to absent himself from England
to go on a pilgrimage. At the same time, the Parliament defined
as before the power of Gloucester, establishing the practical supremacy
of the Council. This definition Bedford accepted. Eventually,
though much against his will, Gloucester was induced to do so also;
but his real view was expressed in the words attributed to him,
“<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">Lat my brother governe as hym lust, whiles he is in this lande, for
after his going overe to Fraunce, I wol governe as me semethe goode.</span>”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
It was plain that the views of Bedford and Gloucester as to the
government of England were very different. Nor had Bedford long
left England to return to France when his brother gave rise to a
fresh scandal. He had already forgotten Jacqueline, and even
while getting supplies from the Commons, with whom he
was very popular, for the purpose of upholding her
cause, had married his former mistress Eleanor Cobham.</p>

<p>On his return to France, the Duke of Bedford found that his
brother’s conduct had increased his difficulties. Richemont, the
brother of the Duke of Brittany, had been won to the French side,
and received the rank of Constable, vacant by the death of Buchan,
and was now using all his influence to induce his brother-in-law
Burgundy to follow his example. Bedford’s presence
for the moment improved the position of the English.
He contrived to renew an alliance with both Burgundy
and Brittany, and was thus secured upon either side of
Normandy. Encouraged by this success, the English generals were
eager to press forward beyond the Loire, which had hitherto been the
limit of their conquests. It seems probable that Bedford, with a
clearer view of the difficulties of his position, would have been well
content to have carried out the wishes of his brother Henry by
securing Normandy. He, however, yielded to the pressure brought
to bear upon him, and in October, the siege of Orleans, situated on
the northernmost angle of the river Loire, and from its
position holding command of that river, was undertaken.
The town itself stands upon the northern bank, but is connected
with a southern suburb, the Portereau, by a bridge, terminating in a
strong castle called Les Tournelles. The siege was intrusted to
Salisbury,<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> who began the attack upon the southern side. He
established his troops in a fortified camp in the ruins of a monastery
of Augustinians, and before long succeeded in capturing Les Tournelles,
and breaking the bridge. He was unfortunately killed, while
examining the country from that fortress, with a view to further investment
of the town. The command devolved upon the Earl of
Suffolk, who succeeded before the close of the year in erecting a
string of thirteen strongholds, called bastides, round the Northern
city. But the weather and want of resources compelled him to put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
these too far apart, and the intercourse of the defenders with an army
of relief under the Count of Clermont at Blois was not broken off.
Early in the following year, this army hoped to raise the siege by
falling on a large body of provisions coming to the besiegers from
Paris under Sir John Fastolf. The attack was made at
Rouvray, but Fastolf had made careful preparations.
The waggons were arranged in a square, and, with the stakes of the
archers, formed a fortification on which the disorderly attack of the
French made but little impression. Broken in the assault, they fell
an easy prey to the English, as they advanced beyond their lines.
The skirmish is known by the name of the Battle of the Herrings.
This victory, which deprived the besieged of hope of external succour,
seemed to render the capture of the city certain.</p>

May 8.</div>
</div>

<p>In Domrémi, a village belonging to the duchy of Bar, the inhabitants
of which, though in the midst of Lorraine, a province under
Burgundian influence, were of patriotic views, lived a village maiden
called Joan of Arc. The period was one of great mental excitement;
as in other times of wide prevailing misery, prophecies and mystical
preachings were current. Joan of Arc’s mind was particularly
susceptible to such influences, and from the time she
was thirteen years old, she had fancied that she heard
voices, and had even seen forms, sometimes of the Archangel Michael,
sometimes of St. Catherine and St. Margaret, who called her to
the assistance of the Dauphin. She persuaded herself that she was destined
to fulfil an old prophecy which said that the kingdom, destroyed
by a woman&mdash;meaning, as she thought, Queen Isabella,&mdash;should be
saved by a maiden of Lorraine. The burning of Domrémi in the
summer of 1428 by a troop of Burgundians at length gave a practical
form to her imaginations, and early in the following year she succeeded
in persuading Robert of Baudricourt to send her, armed and
accompanied by a herald, to Chinon. She there, as it is said by the
wonderful knowledge she displayed, convinced the court of the truth
of her mission. At all events, it was thought wise to take advantage
of the infectious enthusiasm she displayed, and in April she was
intrusted with an army of 6000 or 7000 men, which was to march up
the river from Blois to the relief of Orleans. When she appeared
upon the scene of war, she supplied exactly that element of success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a><br /><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
which the French required. Already long and bitter experience had
taught them the art of war. They were commanded no longer by
favourites of the Court, but by professional soldiers, such as Dunois,
the Bastard of Orleans, La Hire and Saintrailles; and the cause of
their weakness was the deep-rooted immorality both of public and
private life, which the disastrous party struggles of the last reign had
produced. A national instead of a party cry, strict
morality enforced by a Heaven-sent virgin, and the enthusiasm
of religion, were well calculated to remove this cause of weakness.
It is to this combination of experience with enthusiasm that
the success of the French henceforward must be traced. Aided by
the skill of Dunois, Joan succeeded in entering Orleans by water,
while her army the day after marched in unopposed upon the northern
side. After various attacks upon the Bastides, she at length, on
the 6th and 7th of May, attacked the lines upon the south of the
river. The camp in the Augustinian monastery was captured, and
after a fierce assault the Tower of the Tournelles fell into the hands
of the French, Gladsdale, the commander on the left bank, being
killed. The effect of her uniform success, and the superstitious dread
she inspired, is shown by the fact that three such
generals as Suffolk, Talbot and Fastolf, who commanded
on the northern side of the river, took no steps to
assist their distressed comrades, and on the following day raised the
siege.</p>

<p>The release of Orleans was quickly followed up. The English
were hotly pressed. In June, Jargeau on the Loire was taken, and
Suffolk with it; while on the 18th of the same month, Talbot and
Fastolf suffered a thorough defeat at Pataye, while attempting to
save other fortresses lower down the river. Joan of Arc had set
herself two great duties to perform&mdash;the relief of Orleans, and
the coronation of the Dauphin at Rheims. To this second duty she
now addressed herself. Her difficulties arose chiefly from the folly
of the Dauphin, who was under the influence of his favourite, La
Tremouille, a strong Armagnac, whose object it was to prevent his
master from entering upon an independent course of action. These
difficulties were at length overcome. At the head of a
small army, Charles and the Maid of Orleans marched
successfully into the heart of their enemy’s country, securing
either by force or by negotiation the strong cities on the way. At
Rheims the coronation was completed, and thence the French generals
directed their march on Paris at the persuasion of Joan. But there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
while Joan had been overcoming the reluctance of the French Prince,
Bedford had assembled an army of sufficient strength to resist them.
He had summoned to his aid the Bishop of Winchester, who had
returned from his pilgrimage to Rome with instructions to collect
troops to assist the Emperor Sigismund against the heretic Hussites
of Bohemia. With this little army he now joined his nephew; and
Bedford, alarmed by the rapid defection of great towns such as Blois,
Beauvais and Compiègne, determined, if possible, to destroy the superstitious
confidence of the French by a successful battle. In this <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'he was disappoined'">he
was disappointed</ins>, for, after an indecisive skirmish near
Senlis, he was compelled to fall back to cover Paris. For
the present, however, this formed the limit of the French
successes. A fruitless attack on the city, in which the Maid was
wounded, caused timid counsels to prevail, and the army withdrew
behind the Loire.</p>

<p>The winter was employed by Bedford in continued efforts to retain
the friendship of the Duke of Burgundy; and the united armies of
Burgundy and England were attempting to regain Compiègne, when
in March Joan of Arc again took the field. She succeeded in passing
through the two armies, and in entering the city, but
was surprised during a sally and taken prisoner. Her
capture gave the English hopes that they might still
retain their conquests, as the sluggish and vacillating character of
the French King was well known. Bedford set to work to do all he
could to regain the prestige he had lost the preceding year. Shortly
after the coronation of Rheims, he had caused King
Henry to be crowned at Westminster, and with his
brother Gloucester had retired from his official situation. He now
determined to have the coronation repeated in France. Henry was
brought over for that purpose, but it was found impossible to crown
him at Rheims, now completely in the hands of the French. Bedford
had to content himself with a coronation at Paris. Meanwhile
the unfortunate prisoner had been given up to be tried as a
sorceress. She was found guilty, and handed over to the secular arm:
for a moment she was induced to confess herself guilty, abjuring the
truth of her Divine calling; her resumption of arms
in the prison was regarded as a relapse into heresy: she
was therefore burnt at Rouen. The strangely superstitious character
of the age, and the devout belief which existed in sorcery, cannot
excuse what was, in fact, an act of base revenge.</p>

</div>

<p>From this time onwards the fortunes of England declined. Difficulties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
accumulated on all sides. The long war had caused such
a drain on the finances, that the payment of the troops had already
been lowered, and a dangerous mutiny had broken out
at Calais. At the same time, Gloucester’s meddlesome
and overbearing character perpetually kept the Government
at home in disturbance. In 1428, an attack was made on the
Bishop of Winchester. He had returned from Rome a Cardinal, and
with the rank of Papal Legate for the purpose of collecting troops
against the Hussites. His authority thus clashed with that of the
Archbishop of Canterbury, who was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex officio</i> Legate when no one else
was specially appointed to that office. Displeased at being superseded,
Chicheley joined with Gloucester, and suggested that Winchester, by
becoming Legate without royal permission, had incurred the penalties
of præmunire. Winchester was therefore excluded from the Council,
and from the Chapter of the Garter, of which he was the Prelate, held
in 1429. His place in the Council was restored to him in gratitude
for his conduct in the following year, when he lent troops to Bedford
after the relief of Orleans. Nevertheless, during his absence in 1431,
he was asked to resign his bishopric, as being the officer of a foreign
power, and Gloucester brought formal charges against him, and caused
the writ of præmunire to be actually prepared. The execution of the
writ was postponed till the King’s return, when Beaufort was allowed
to clear himself, and a declaration vouching for his loyalty given him
under the Great Seal. While thus attacking the Cardinal, Gloucester
had been attempting to increase his popularity, already
very great, by assuming the position of champion of the
Church, and persecutor of heresy. In 1430, a man calling himself Jack
Sharpe had been put to death at Oxford, and a clergyman of Essex
had also been burnt. But there was evidently still existing a strong
undercurrent of Lollardism; for the people came in crowds to the
place of execution, and made offerings as though the victim of persecution
had been a saint. But even worse for Bedford than these troubles
at home was the loss of his wife, who died in November 1432, childless,
thus breaking the strongest link which had hitherto bound England
and Burgundy together. This misfortune was made worse by
one of the few acts of indiscretion which can be alleged against
Bedford. He married Jacquetta, daughter of the Count of Saint-Pol,
of the House of Luxembourg, a marriage in itself
politic enough, but which, contracted as it was without
the permission of Burgundy, the lady’s feudal superior,
caused a quarrel between the two Dukes. This was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
second heavy blow which the alliance between England and Burgundy
had received. Yet this alliance was absolutely necessary for
the successful carrying on of the war. It began to be a question
whether peace of some sort was not becoming necessary. Bedford
even in the year 1431 received leave from the English Parliament to
treat. Abroad the feeling in favour of peace was still stronger. Pope
Eugenius IV. had set seriously to work to put an end to the warfare.
The Emperor Sigismund, with Frederick of Austria and Louis of
Orange, alarmed at the rising power of the Burgundian House, had
made offers of assistance to the French King. The Bretons, headed
by the Count of Richemont, were anxious to renew their natural alliance
with France. Burgundy himself, in 1432, had gone so far as to
make an armistice with the French; the presence at the French Court
of La Tremouille, one of the murderers of the Duke’s father and the
constant supporter of the war, seemed the only obstacle to reconciliation:
if that reconciliation were made Bedford must of necessity
make peace. Other difficulties were leading him in the same direction.
The finances were in the greatest disorder; the garrison of
Calais mutinied for pay. Bedford therefore, in 1433, returned to England
to see what could be done. He made Lord Ralph
Cromwell his treasurer, and intrusted him with the duty
of examining and making a statement as to the condition
of the finances. It became apparent that the yearly outgoing exceeded
the income by £25,000. Bedford at once insisted on economy, and
patriotically gave up a considerable portion of his own salaries. But
the discovery of his failing resources, the necessity for his presence in
England, where Lords and Commons united in intreating him to remain,
the increase of the power of France, and the constant danger of reconciliation
between Charles and Burgundy, induced him to be quite
ready to make arrangements for a peace on honourable terms which
should include the possession of Normandy. Such views did not
suit Gloucester. He put himself prominently forward as the head of
the war party, producing a great but impracticable plan for pressing
the war with vigour. Bedford’s residence in England was short.
During his absence all went wrong; St. Denis was lost, and the Earl
of Arundel taken prisoner. He was forced to return to France, and
to leave the parties in England (now clearly defined as peace and war
parties) to carry on their quarrels. But the general feeling for the
necessity of peace, and for the release from their long imprisonment
of the captives taken at Agincourt, gained ground abroad. So
much was this the case, that Burgundy found means to assemble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
on the 14th of July what may be fairly called a European congress,
at Arras, to settle if possible the peace of Europe.
Thither came ambassadors from the Council of Bâle, (at
that time sitting,) the Legate of the Pope, and ministers
from the Emperor, Castile, Aragon, Navarre, Portugal, Naples,
Sicily, Poland, Denmark, the Parisian University, and the great commercial
towns of the Hansa and of Flanders. Archbishop John of York
at first represented England. The Duke of Bourbon, who had already
entered into agreement with Burgundy, represented France. Even on
their first appearance, the English ambassadors were displeased with
the precedence given to the French. The rival demands were these:&mdash;France
wished either for a peace with Burgundy, and the continuation
of the war with England, or if there was a cessation of that war,
that the peace should be unconditional, with the restoration of all
prisoners and all conquests, the three Norman bishoprics alone being
left to the English, and those only as fiefs of the French crown; the
English demanded the retention of their present possessions and an
armistice. The pretensions of the two nations were evidently incompatible;
even Cardinal Beaufort, who had joined the congress, was
afraid of the war party at home, and on the 6th of September the
English embassy withdrew.</p>

</div>

<p>At this inopportune moment an event happened which settled the
wavering mind of Burgundy, and induced him to make
a full reconciliation with the French. This event was
the death of the Duke of Bedford. There was no one to
fill the place of that great man. It had been his personal influence
more than anything else which had kept Burgundy true to England.
On his death the Duke at once declared himself ready to receive
the terms which France offered. These were humiliating enough.
Charles apologized for the death of Duke John, declared that he held
the act in abhorrence, that he had been brought to consent to it by
the advice of wicked ministers, and would henceforward exclude all
Armagnacs from his council. At the same time he granted to Burgundy,
Macon and Auxerre, together with the basin of the Somme,
or Ponthieu. At first, news of this treaty served only to arouse the
warlike feeling of the English. The appearance of the
Burgundian envoy in London was the signal for violent
riots. It was determined to prosecute the war with vigour. A great
loan was raised throughout the country, and the prosecution intrusted
to the young Duke of York. It was not to be expected that
this young prince, however great his ability, could do what Bedford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
had been unable to accomplish. United with Burgundy, England
had scarcely held its position in France. Against France and Burgundy
united, it was helpless.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Continued ill

1437.</div>

<p>Already before York’s arrival a great piece of Normandy, and even
Harfleur, had been lost. In April the French King, with Burgundy,
advanced on Paris, and was admitted by the townspeople. The war
party grew only more obstinate. Gloucester revived his absurd
claims upon Flanders in right of Jacqueline, and assumed the title of
Count of Flanders. York and Talbot succeeded in driving back the
Burgundians from Calais; but this was almost the only English
success. In July 1437, York was recalled, and Beauchamp,
Earl of Warwick,<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> appointed in his place. But
it was too late for any one to check the advance of the
French. That country was indeed exhausted and miserable to the
last degree; but England was in little better plight. For several
years the plague had been raging, and an unusually bad harvest
added to the horrors of disease. Bread there was none, the people
were reduced to live on pulse.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Danger from

<div class="sidenotex">James’s death.</div>
</div>

<p>Moreover, the English forces were divided by the threatening
aspect of affairs in Scotland. The young King had done his best
to keep his promise of peace, but found it impossible to
break off the long-standing connection with France.
In 1428, his daughter Margaret had been betrothed to Charles VII.’s
son, Louis of Anjou. This had excited the fears of the English, and
in the following year, the Bishop of Winchester, under the plea of
collecting help for his proposed crusade against the Hussites, had
visited Edinburgh. A marriage treaty had even been proposed
between the two countries, but it came to nothing, and a vigorous
diplomatic struggle was still being carried on between the rival
parties of France and England, when, in 1434, the folly of Sir Robert
Ogle, who led a raid into the Scotch Lowlands, turned the scale in
favour of the French. The marriage between Margaret and Louis of
Anjou was at once carried out, and, in 1436, an army, with King
James at its head, attacked Roxburgh. Fortunately for England, the
Scotch King, bred at the Court of Henry V., and eager
to introduce into his own kingdom the orderly constitution
he had known in England, had excited the anger of his
nobles. News of a conspiracy reached him, and he withdrew from
his invasion only to fall a victim to that conspiracy in the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
year. Weakened by these domestic confusions, Scotland was content
to enter into a truce for ten years.</p>

<p>Neither the suffering of the people, nor the danger from Scotland,
nor the constant want of success abroad, had any influence on the
passionate obstinacy of Gloucester. Meetings with regard
to peace were in vain held at Paris, the English refused
to recede from their demands. At length, however,
Cardinal Beaufort and the peace party so far prevailed,
that, after the fall of Meaux, they procured the liberation of the
Duke of Orleans, hoping to find in him an efficient mediator. As a
protest against the measure, while the Duke was taking the oaths
required of him before his liberation, Gloucester, refusing to be
present, betook himself to his barge and remained upon the river.
The measure did not produce the desired effect. The Duke of Warwick
had died in May 1439. Somerset, who had succeeded him, retook
Harfleur, but, in the two following years, not only did the French
successes increase in Normandy, even Guienne was in its turn
assaulted. All efforts to save it were in vain, and it became quite
evident that the policy of peace was the only one which could
extricate England with honour from its disastrous situation.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Pre-eminence of

</div>

<p>The death of Bedford had left Cardinal Beaufort at the head of the
party who desired a reasonable peace. But Beaufort was
old, and the influence of Gloucester, as first Prince of
the blood and the leader of the popular party, kept him
much aloof from public business. In his place there arose a new
minister, De la Pole, Earl of Suffolk. This man, a descendant of a
wealthy merchant in the reign of Edward III., and grandson of the
favourite of Richard II., was fully engaged upon the side of
the Lancastrian dynasty. He had been taken prisoner after the
siege of Orleans, and had in France formed connections which pointed
him out as a fitting person to manage negotiations with that country.
It was determined, if possible, to make the marriage of the young
King with a French Princess the basis of a peace.
The Princess fixed on was Margaret, the daughter
of Réné, Duke of Bar, representative of the Angevin
house, the titular King of Sicily and of Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Suffolk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
undertook to manage the delicate negotiation, although conscious,
it would seem, of the obloquy he would probably meet with.
He succeeded in obtaining an armistice to extend from June
1444 till April 1446, and the marriage treaty was completed; but
so far from receiving a dower with his wife, as might have been
expected, (but which her father, who had surrendered his duchy to the
Duke of Burgundy, was quite unable to give,) it was arranged that
Henry should surrender to the French, as the price of their consent,
all that was left to the English of Anjou and Maine, where the war was
still being carried on. In carrying out this arrangement, Suffolk had
the consent of the Privy Council, but it is probable that they did not
contemplate so complete a cession of English rights.
His successful return secured him the title of Marquis,
and the friendship of the young Queen (whose masculine mind soon
got entire command of her husband’s will), and enabled him to hold
a position of complete superiority in the English councils.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gloucester’s
death.</div>

<p>Alliance with the French, on the somewhat disgraceful terms on
which it had been contracted, not unnaturally raised the anger of
Gloucester and his party. The rivalry grew hot between him and
Suffolk. There were probably private causes of trouble between them,
but at all events, in 1447, the Parliament was held at Bury St. Edmunds,
and Gloucester was summoned thither. He went with a considerable
following, but does not seem to have suspected danger, although he
found the town fortified, and the guards everywhere doubled. He
was suddenly apprehended on the charge of high treason, and before
any trial was granted him, the public were told that he
was dead. A death so opportune for his enemies naturally
excited suspicion, and the most sinister rumours of foul play
were spread among the people. It is impossible not to join in these
suspicions; at the same time it is fair to notice that at a late examination
his physician had declared his constitution radically unsound,
and that some contemporary writers mention his death as having
arisen from natural causes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">York takes his
place.</div>

<p>His death left room for Richard Duke of York’s appearance upon
the stage of politics. The son of Anne, sister of the
Earl of March, and of that Duke of Cambridge who was
put to death for his share in the conspiracy immediately preceding
Henry V.’s first expedition to France, he stepped naturally into the
place of leader of the Plantagenet Princes. Ever since that family
ascended the throne, those branches of it which had not been actually
reigning had been for the most part in opposition. Till their accession,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
the Lancastrians had been the leaders of this party; their place was
now taken first by Gloucester, then by York. It will be seen in the
sequel that those same families which had formed the discontented party
in the reign of Richard II., and in opposition to the Lancastrians, now
sided chiefly with York. He had been already employed in public
affairs, had been twice governor of Normandy, and in that capacity
had quarrelled with the Duke of Somerset, who had been joined with
him in command. To rid himself of so important an enemy, Suffolk,
the leading statesman of the ruling party, had got him appointed in
1446 to the government of Ireland. This was a post of considerable
difficulty; for under the management of the Earls of Ormond, one of
the old Anglo-Irish settlers, that country had fallen into great disorder.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Absolute
ministry of
Suffolk.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">His unpopularity.</div>
</div>

<p>After Gloucester’s death Suffolk had become unquestioned chief
Minister, for Cardinal Beaufort had not long survived
his nephew. He took upon himself all the unpopularity
which the Lancastrian dynasty had latterly earned.
It is plain that among the people there was deep-seated discontent.
The persecution of the Lollards had never relented. Frequent executions
are recorded for heresy. The support the Lancastrians had
constantly given to the Church had even produced several outbreaks.
In 1438, and again in 1443, there had been uproars in several parts
of England, directed against the Catholic ecclesiastical foundations.
Nor was this unnatural. Amidst the misery and desolation caused
by repeated plagues and famines, and the expenditure
both of men and money incident upon a foreign war,
the Church alone, represented by the wealthy Cardinal Beaufort, had
retained its prosperity; while, to crown all, national honour had been
deeply wounded by want of success in France. To this inherited
unpopularity, Suffolk added that which arose from the late dishonourable
marriage treaty with France. Instead of attempting to
lessen the feeling against him, he followed the common course of
upstart ministers. The Princes and great nobles found themselves
excluded from the Council. His ministers were chiefly bishops,
especially Ascough, Bishop of Salisbury, and De Moleyns, Bishop of
Chichester, and men of little eminence, as Lord Say. His government
in fact resembled that of Bernard of Armagnac in France, and took
that particularly objectionable form, the superiority of the lesser nobles.</p>

<p>His foreign policy, too, was eminently unsuccessful. At the close
of the truce, in 1446, he had not secured any permanent
peace; and early in 1448, an ill-judged outbreak of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
English auxiliaries, who captured the town of Fougères, again plunged
England into war. John, Duke of Somerset, perhaps in despair at
his ill success, had killed himself. His brother Edmund succeeded
to his title and position in France. His opposition to the French,
who attacked him in great force, was entirely unavailing, and before
the year was over Rouen and a large part of Normandy had been
regained by the French. In May an armament under Sir Thomas
Kyriel had been defeated near Formigny; in July Caen surrendered;
and in August the last remnants of the English army returned to
England from Cherbourg. In the following year a last effort was
made to retain some position in Guienne with equally bad success.</p>

</div>

<p>The loss of Rouen, in 1449, brought the anger of the people to its
highest point. In an uproar they put to death De
Moleyns, Bishop of Chichester, at Portsmouth; and at
length the House of Commons, led by Tresham their speaker, insisted
upon the apprehension of Suffolk, who had now become a
Duke, upon a charge of treason. On the 7th of February
eight charges were brought against him of a somewhat
indefinite character, especially charging him with a wish
to marry his son John to Margaret Beaufort, thus aiming at the
kingdom, and with gross mismanagement and treachery in France.
These were followed by sixteen more specific charges, in which it was
asserted that he had appropriated and misused the royal revenues,
interfered with the course of justice, and treated treacherously with
the French. On the 13th he appeared before the King in the House
of Peers. He denied most of the charges, and excused himself on
others on the ground that he had acted with the approbation of the
Privy Council. He however, declining the privilege of his peerage
and trial by the House of Lords, threw himself entirely upon the
King’s mercy; and Henry, hoping to get over the difficulty without
giving up his friend, without a trial banished him for five years.
This was a manifest breach of the Constitution, and served only to
increase the general discontent. The Duke escaped privately to his
own estates, and took sea at Ipswich, but was met by an English
squadron, taken on board the largest ship, the “Nicholas of the Tower,”
and after a sham trial by the seamen, obliged to enter a little boat.
He was there beheaded, with a sort of parody of the
usual forms of execution. It is pretty evident that
behind the popular anger there was the influence of the Duke of
York and other noblemen at work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jack Cade.</div>

<p>At the next Parliament, which was held at Leicester, many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
nobles appeared in arms. At the same time the news of the defeat of
Kyriel at Formigny arrived; and at once the men of Kent, who were
probably in close alliance with the seamen who had executed Suffolk,
rose. Their leader was Jack Cade. He led the insurgents
under strict discipline towards London, assuming
the name of Mortimer, and we cannot but believe with the knowledge
of the Duke of York. Two papers were sent in to the Government;
one called the Complaints, the other the Demands, of the Commons of
Kent. In these were summed up the causes of the unpopularity of
Suffolk; and the restoration of Richard of York to favour was
demanded. Unable to hold their advanced position, the insurgents
fell back to Sevenoaks, but there they were successful against a hasty
attack by Sir Humphrey Stafford.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The King retired from London,
and so far yielded as to order the apprehension of Lord Say, one of
the obnoxious councillors. Cade then advanced, took possession of
Southwark, and appeared in London, under the title of the Captain of
Kent, and in the arms of Stafford. The burghers of London, full of
sympathy for the demands of the Kentish men, and pleased with the
strict discipline preserved, sided at first with the insurgents. At a
formal trial presided over by the Lord Mayor, Say, who had fallen
into the hands of the people, was condemned and immediately
executed. Meanwhile, almost at the same time, Ascough, the obnoxious
Bishop of Salisbury, was put to death by his own followers at
Eddington. Thus all the obnoxious ministers had been got rid of.
London was now in the hands of the populace. The temptation was
too strong for them, and some plundering took place. On this the
Londoners took fright, and, when the insurgents retired for the night
to Southwark, broke down and defended the bridge. Cade, unable
to regain London, fell back, and after his followers, deceived by a
promise of general pardon, had chiefly dispersed, was pursued and put
to death near Lewes by Iden the sheriff.</p>

</div>

<p>The disaffection was by no means quieted. Complaints were bitter,
that by repeated prorogations of Parliament supplies were
obtained without any redress of grievances, and that the
bishops and clergy sided with the oppressors. While public feeling was
in this irritable condition, York, suddenly leaving his
government of Ireland without leave, appeared on the
Welsh border with 4000 of his vassals. In this threatening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
manner, and accompanied by the Duke of Norfolk, the Earls of
Devonshire and Salisbury, the whole clan of the Nevilles, and the Lords
Cromwell<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and Cobham, he appeared at Westminster. Meanwhile,
Somerset, the acknowledged head of the rival party, returned from
France, and received the office of Constable. The parties were assuming
form, and a crisis was evidently at hand. York made a formal
demand for the dismissal of Somerset and the punishment of the
Duchess of Suffolk. As yet, however, the Government was strong
enough to refuse these demands, and during the whole of the year
1451, without any public acts, the quarrel was becoming more embittered.
In Devonshire Lord Bonville was at open war with the
Earl of Devonshire. In the North, Percy, Lord Egremont, was fighting
with the Earl of Salisbury. And in the winter, the Welsh vassals
of York were gathered round the castle of Ludlow. Hitherto York
and his partisans had persistently declared themselves the faithful
servants of the Crown, interested only in the removal of the King’s
bad ministers. None the less, in the beginning of the year 1452,
Somerset and the King marched into the West, where York had been
collecting his vassals, while York, moving in the opposite direction,
passed the royal troops, and appeared in Kent, where he felt sure of
support.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He is duped into
submission.</div>

<p>This summoned the King back towards London; he took up his
position at Blackheath, and there received the demands
of York, to which he consented, promising to imprison
Somerset, and to form a new council. Trusting to this promise, York
disbanded his army, and went to have an interview with the King.
He there discovered, to his dismay, that he had been deceived. His
rival was in the tent, and evidently still in favour. Hot words were
exchanged, but ultimately York was compelled to renew his oath of
loyalty, and the Somerset party for the instant triumphed. The next
Parliament was strongly in their favour; the speaker, Thomas
Thorpe, a strong partisan of the Lancastrians. The King’s half-brothers,
the sons of Owen Tudor, (Edmund, Earl of Richmond, and
Jasper, Earl of Pembroke,) were brought prominently forward as
members of the royal house, and Cardinal Kemp, now Archbishop of
Canterbury and Chancellor, declared that the Government would
enforce peace by arms if necessary.</p>

<p>This triumph was of short duration. News arrived of the failure of

Talbot, Lord Shrewsbury, its leader, at Castillon. And worse than
that, the King, who had all his life suffered both from
bodily and intellectual weakness, fell into a condition of
hopeless imbecility. Under these circumstances, the
birth of a Prince called Edward, which might have
added to the strength of the Lancastrian party, was but a source of
weakness. York, as heir presumptive to the throne of a sickly
monarch, might have been contented to wait; the birth of a new
heir apparent urged him to do what he had to do quickly. The
opportunity, too, now offered itself; during the imbecility of the
King, some regent was wanted; there was no excuse for
passing over York. An instant change of government
was the consequence. Somerset was apprehended. Even the Parliament
chosen under the Lancastrian influence could not refuse, after
it had obtained proof of Henry’s folly, to appoint Richard. The
amount of authority given him seems to have been exactly that which
Gloucester had enjoyed. He was President of the Council, and chief
executive officer. His office was terminable at the royal will.
Though thus limited, his power was sufficient to enable him to
change the constitution of the Council, to carry through a breach of
Parliamentary privilege by imprisoning for a debt Thorpe the speaker,
and on the death of Cardinal Kemp, to appoint his brother-in-law
Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury, to the chancellorship.</p>

</div>

<p>But the supremacy of York disappeared as suddenly as it had
arisen. At the end of 1454, on Christmas Day, the King recovered
his senses. Everything was immediately reversed. Somerset was
taken from the Tower and declared innocent. York’s
officers were displaced. True to the policy of his house,
Henry restored the chancellorship to the Church by the
appointment of Thomas Bouchier, Archbishop of Canterbury. But
York had now determined upon an appeal to arms. Urged by fear
of Somerset, and by dislike to the secondary position which the
Prince’s birth had given him, and in company with the Nevilles, Lord
Salisbury, and his son the Earl of Warwick, he advanced
towards London, to forestall the action of the
Parliament summoned to meet at Leicester, which he expected to be
hostile to him. At the same time the royal troops were marching
northward. The two forces consequently met. From Royston, York
wrote a letter still declaring his loyalty, and stating his conditions.
It was unanswered, and on the 21st of May the armies met at St.
Albans. The King had with him the Dukes of Somerset and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
Buckingham, the Earls of Northumberland, Pembroke, Devonshire,
Stafford, Dorset, Wiltshire, Clifford, and Sudely. The
battle was fought in the town, and the victory, chiefly
owing to Warwick, fell to the Duke of York. Somerset,
Northumberland, and Clifford fell. Most of the other leaders were
wounded, and the King himself was suffering from an arrow wound
when York and the Nevilles came to him, knelt before him, begged
his favour, and carried him with them in apparent harmony to London.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character of the
two parties.</div>

<p>On examining the chief names which occur as those of the leaders
on either side in this the first battle of the Wars of the Roses, it
will be seen that it was the Nevilles and Norfolk
chiefly on whom York relied; his own relations, the
Percies, and other gentlemen of the North, which constituted the
strength of Henry’s party. There seem to have been three principles
of division at work&mdash;family, geographical position, political views;
and with regard to family, it would seem that the quarrel was one of
very long standing, dating back as far as the reign of Richard II. It
has been already pointed out that there was constantly some branch
or other of the Plantagenet party in opposition to the reigning branch,
which took for its cry reform of government and the good cause of
England. In Richard II.’s reign Gloucester had represented this
party. If we take the names of the Lords Appellant in the year
1387, we find them to be Gloucester and Derby, Plantagenets;
Warwick, a Beauchamp; Nottingham, a Mowbray; and Arundel.
Now, of these, the second, Derby, became afterwards King as Henry
IV., and the opposition which he had at one time helped to direct
was turned against himself and his family. The families of Mowbray
and of Arundel had coalesced in the Duke of Norfolk. The heiress
of the Beauchamps had married the Earl of Salisbury’s son Richard
Neville, who with his wife had inherited the title of Warwick.
The addition therefore to the party was that of the important family
of the Nevilles, which had been consistently faithful to Henry IV.
But this family had now become allied by marriage with the Duke
of York himself (who had married Cecily Neville), with the Duke of
Norfolk, and as we have seen with the family of Beauchamp. In
addition to this, the fact that the rival house of the Percies had since
the restoration of the son of Hotspur been firm supporters of the
Lancastrian dynasty, would have been enough to put the Nevilles on
the opposite side. The two families had ever been rivals for the
chief influence in the North of England; and even now Lord Egremont,
a Percy, was at open war with the Earl of Salisbury in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
neighbourhood of York. Of the leaders appearing on the side of
Henry, Northumberland was a Percy, and therefore enemy of the
Nevilles; Somerset was a Beaufort, and of the Lancastrian house;
Pembroke and Richmond were the King’s half-brothers; Clifford
was one of the great lords of the North, and an opponent of the
Nevilles; Wiltshire was James Butler of Ormond, of that family
whose misgovernment York had been sent to cure. Of Buckingham
and the Staffords, whose mother was a Plantagenet, it may be supposed
that in the family quarrel they preferred the reigning house.</p>

<p>This seems to lead to the conclusion that in the main the war was
a fight of faction, a tissue of hereditary family rivalries resting upon
merely personal grounds. But beyond these there were geographical
and political reasons which had their influence on the bulk of the
nation. The demand for reform of government, the support given to
the national prejudice in favour of continued war, and the opposition
to the strong Church views of the Government, had rendered the party
of York distinctly the popular one. The North of England was
always more subject than the South to baronial influence. It was in
the South therefore, in Kent, and in the trading cities, that the
strength of the Yorkist party chiefly lay. To this of course must be
added the very large estates held by York himself, as the heir of the
Mortimers in the West; and the vast property of the various branches
of the Nevilles. On the other hand, the Lancastrian party was that
of the lower nobility, and of the Church, and found its strength in
the baronial North. Politically, to speak broadly, it was the party of
the Conservative gentry and the High Church, pitted against the
party of reform of Church and State headed by a few great nobles;
geographically, it was the North withstanding the attacks of the South.</p>

</div>

<p>One effect of the battle of St. Albans was, that the King again sank
into lethargy. Again, for a brief space, was the power of York
irresistible; he was appointed by the Lords to his old
position of Protector. He was still careful not to speak
of his claim to the crown, and accepted the Protectorate
only as the gift of both Houses of Parliament. Again, however, the
King suddenly recovered. In February, York was removed from
his protectorate, and the Queen and Somerset were again ruling.
The following year, a great meeting of the Council was held at
Coventry, where York and his friends were again compelled to renew
their fealty. But the loss of life at St. Albans had rendered the party
feud much more violent, and York was induced to believe that the
Queen had aims against his life. He and his friends at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
separated; York to his western castle of Wigmore, Salisbury to
Middleham in Yorkshire, Warwick to Calais, of which
town he was the governor. Whatever influence the
King had seems to have been directed to produce reconciliation.
For this purpose he induced, in January, the rival chiefs to
meet in London. The peace of the town was intrusted to the citizens,
and a solemn reconciliation brought about, based upon
money payments to be made by the Yorkists to the
sufferers at St. Albans. Meanwhile, Warwick, a lawless
and independent person, was living as a sort of authorized pirate at
Calais. He attacked a fleet of ships, as he believed Spanish; they
afterwards proved to be Hanseatic vessels. He was consequently
summoned to Court to explain his conduct. There a quarrel arose
between his servants and those of the King, and at once the ephemeral
reconciliation was destroyed.</p>

<p>Both parties prepared again for war. The Court having been
told that Salisbury was going to Kenilworth to concert measures
with Duke Richard, Lord Audley was sent with an armed force
to intercept him. The consequence was the battle of
Blore Heath on the confines of Shropshire, in which
Salisbury was completely victorious. A general meeting
of the three great Yorkist nobles took place at Ludlow, where
Warwick brought his veterans from Calais, under Sir Andrew
Trollope. Again the old proclamation against evil governors was
issued; but for some unexplained reason Trollope suddenly deserted,
and, deprived of their most trustworthy troops, the leaders thought
it wise to fly. York took refuge in Ireland, with his son
Edmund of Rutland, while his eldest son, Edward of
March, with Warwick, found security in Calais. Their
flight caused something like a revolution, so complete was the triumph
of the Lancastrians. The Parliament was assembled at Coventry,
probably with much illegal violence, and bills of attainder
were passed against the Yorkist leaders. But
Warwick was determined upon further action. Having
command of the sea, he contrived an interview with Richard in
Ireland, and accompanied by his father and the young Earl of March,
he landed in Kent, where he was rapidly joined by the people, and
appeared at the head of 30,000 men in London. Having
captured the capital, with the exception of the Tower,
which Lord Scales held, they advanced northwards. The
two armies met in the neighbourhood of Northampton.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
The Lancastrians were strongly intrenched, but the intrenchment once
broken through, a terrible slaughter ensued. Buckingham, Shrewsbury,
Beaumont, and Egremont were slain. The wretched King was found
deserted in his tent. Again the scene after St. Albans was repeated,
and York, returning from Ireland, was once more master of affairs.</p>

Parliament in

<div class="sidenotex">York at last
advances claims
to the throne.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">The Lords agree
on a compromise.</div>
</div>

<p>On the 7th of October a Parliament was held in London. All the
acts of the Parliament of Coventry were annulled, on the ground
that its members had been illegally elected, and in some
instances that they had not been elected at all. And
then first did York, who appears to have thought that
all less decided measures had been tried in vain, bring forward a
distinct claim to the throne. This claim he sent in writing to the
House of Lords, with whom alone it was said the decision
could lie, pointing out, what was undeniable, that
his hereditary claim was better than that of Henry VI.
The majority of the Lords were at heart Lancastrian. They had,
moreover, again and again sworn fealty to the reigning house; and
to their common sense as proprietors it seemed ridiculous that an
undisturbed possession of more than fifty years, defended by numerous
Acts of Parliament, should be set aside by mere hereditary claim.
With the Yorkists triumphant, they were naturally disinclined to
give any answer, but it was in vain they applied to the judges or to
the crown lawyers. The judges declared the question beyond their
cognizance, and the crown lawyers argued that it was therefore much
more beyond theirs. Thrown back upon themselves, the Lords
devised a compromise by which they could save their consciences
with regard to the oath of fealty, and yet give effect to the hereditary
claim, which was urged by such awkwardly strong supporters. They
agreed that the King should hold the crown for life, that
it should then pass to Richard and his heirs, that Richard
should meanwhile be created Prince of Wales and heir presumptive,
and be the practical ruler of the Kingdom. That in spite of his
victorious position he should have been able only to secure this compromise,
seems to prove the close equality of the parties, and perhaps,
taken in connection with his previous action, the moderation of
Richard.</p>

<p>The Queen had no intention of submitting to this verdict. Trusting
to the power of the North, which was constantly true to her, and
collecting round her all the great chiefs of her party, she moved to
York. Richard at once determined to hasten against her. Salisbury
accompanied him; Edward, his eldest son, was ordered to collect troops;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
Warwick was charged with the care of the King. With extreme
rashness, York met vastly superior forces in the neighbourhood of
Wakefield. Unexpectedly attacked, his little army was
completely destroyed. He was himself taken prisoner,
dragged with every sign of indignity before the Queen,
mockingly crowned with a wreath of grass, and then beheaded. His
second son, Rutland, but seventeen years of age, was killed in cold
blood as he fled, and Salisbury, who was also captured, was beheaded
at the demand of the people. March was collecting
troops in the West when he heard of his father’s death,
and hastening northwards, he suddenly turned upon a
small pursuing force under Pembroke and Wiltshire,
and completely defeated them at Mortimer’s Cross. The
Queen’s army meanwhile pushed southward. The wild northerners
seemed to fancy they were marching through a foreign country.
The fiercest destruction and plundering marked the course of their
march. To meet them, Norfolk and Warwick had come
from London to St. Albans, and there a second battle
was fought, this time with the complete defeat of the
Yorkists. The King again fell into the hands of the
Queen. This battle, as all the others during these wars,
was marked by extraordinary destruction among the chiefs, and
followed by vindictive executions. Had the Queen pushed direct to
London the Yorkist party might have been destroyed.
But she could not hold her wild troops in hand. Their
devastations excited the anger of the people. All round
London the populace rose, determined to avoid the government which
promised to be so cruel. The young Earl of March,
whom Warwick had joined with the remnant of his
troops, took advantage of this feeling, and advanced
triumphantly to the capital. At a meeting in Clerkenwell, the
Chancellor, the Bishop of Exeter, explained the claims of the House
of York. The question “Shall Edward be your King?” was
received with general cries of approbation. The news was brought
to the young prince in Baynard’s Castle, and the next day he ascended
the throne in Westminster Hall, explained with his own lips his
hereditary claims, and then proceeded to the Abbey where his
coronation was performed.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Though in after years much addicted to sensual pleasure,
Edward IV. never lost his practical energy; he was not a man
to leave unimproved his present triumphant position.
He at once despatched the Duke of Norfolk to the East
of England to collect an army, and with the Earl of Warwick
himself hastened northward, with an army composed chiefly of
Welshmen from his own possessions, and of men of Kent, the great
supporters of his house. In Yorkshire he met his enemy. The passage
of the river Aire was disputed at Ferry Bridge; the Yorkists,
under Lord Falconbridge (a Neville), falling upon the rear of Clifford
and his Lancastrians, stopped his passage, and killed that leader. On
the 28th of March the armies were in presence, some eight miles from
York. The battle was to be a decisive one. No quarter
was to be expected on either side. The numbers engaged&mdash;of
the Lancastrians, 60,000, of the Yorkists 48,000&mdash;were
much larger than in most of the battles of these wars. For once
the nation felt some interest in the quarrel. The change of the wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
blew the snow continually in the eyes of the Lancastrians, and when
the battle had raged through a great part of the night and till noon
of the following day, the Yorkists had secured a complete victory.
Again, the greatest names of the nobility are mentioned among the
slain. Northumberland fell in the battle, Devonshire and Wiltshire
were beheaded after it, and many reports speak of from 28,000 to
33,000 men left dead upon the field.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Henry and his Queen, with
Somerset and Exeter, fled into Scotland, and purchased such assistance
as that country could give in the midst of its own intestine commotions
by a promise of Berwick and Carlisle. Edward now felt
safe on his throne, and returned to London, where the joy was great.
There, in November, he met his first Parliament, by
whom the three last monarchs were declared usurpers,
and the acts of their reigns annihilated, with the exception of such
judicial decisions as would if repealed have thrown the country into
confusion. All the great leaders of the Lancastrian party were
attainted, and their property confiscated. The session closed with a
personal address of thanks from the King to the Commons, an
unusual occurrence, and marking the political position of the House of
York.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Margaret had been seeking assistance from her own
country, France; but Louis, busy in his own affairs and
content with the enforced neutrality of England, only
gave her a small sum of money, and allowed Peter de
Brezé, Seneschal of Normandy, to enlist troops for her.
With these forces she succeeded in capturing the three northern
fortresses of Bamborough, Dunstanburgh and Alnwick. But before
the end of the year, the two first of these were recovered, and Edward
was so strong, that even Somerset and Percy deserted to his side. Again,
the next year, the Queen with De Brezé attempted in vain to relieve
Alnwick. Her fleet was wrecked, and with difficulty she made her
way back to Scotland. But, though beaten, her cause was still alive.
In various parts of the country, disturbances showed themselves.
The clergy missed the favour they had received from the Lancastrians;
and, in the beginning of the following year, the Percies and Somerset
had gone back to their own party, and renewed attempts were made
upon the North of England. But Warwick’s brother
Montague, at Hedgeley Moor, and again at Hexham,
destroyed their forces, and both Percy and Somerset met
their death. This was the second Duke of Somerset who had died in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
these wars. He was succeeded by his brother Edmund. A greater
prize was the King, who, after hiding for some time, was captured, in
1465, in Yorkshire, and brought with all signs of indignity to London.
He was there, however, properly taken care of in the Tower.</p>

</div>

<p>Supported by his Commons, who granted him the wool tax and
tonnage and poundage for life, King Edward seemed firmly seated
on the throne. He was essentially a popular king. He sat and
judged on his own King’s Bench, talked familiarly with the people,
and allowed the Commons to pass popular measures of finance,
without regard to their want of wisdom. A revocation of grants
from the Crown was made, but with exceptions which
rendered it nugatory; the importation of foreign corn
or foreign merchandise was forbidden. The arrangement of the
staple, by which wool and cloth could be sold only at Calais, and for
bullion or ready money, was re-established; and still further to
uphold the current theory of the day, and to keep gold and silver in
the country, strict sumptuary laws were passed. Abroad,
too, all seemed peaceful. The Pope had acknowledged
the new King. France was too busy to interfere. With
the rest of Europe treaties of amity were set on foot; and even with
Scotland a long truce was made.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Destroyed by

<div class="sidenotex">and rise of the

</div>

<p>But the King had a weakness of character which destroyed his fine
position. He was a slave to his passions; and now, regardless of all
prudence, though various royal matches were suggested, especially one
with Bona of Savoy, the sister of the French Queen, he was carried
away by his admiration for Elizabeth Woodville, the
daughter of Jacquetta, the Duchess Dowager of Bedford,
and Richard Woodville, Lord Rivers, and the widow of Sir
John Grey, a strong Lancastrian partisan. On the 29th of September,
in spite of the opposition which he could not but have expected,
the King was publicly married in the chapel at Reading. Had not
the King recognised the weakness of the nobility, caused by the
slaughters of the late wars, he would scarcely have ventured on a
marriage so much beneath him. As it was, the few great nobles who
remained were deeply hurt, and Edward found himself obliged to
make the best of his plebeian marriage. An unusually ostentatious
and solemn coronation was held, and an air of aristocracy given to
the ceremony by the presence of his wife’s relative, John of Luxembourg.
His other measures for the same purpose were not so well
judged. The marriage might have been pardoned had it not brought
with it the elevation of the whole of the Queen’s family, whom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
King thought it necessary to raise in social rank. Her father was
made an Earl, and given in succession the offices of
Constable and Treasurer, and this at the expense of
the nobles who were then holding those places. Her brother
Anthony, a man of great accomplishments, was given the daughter,
inheritance, and titles of Lord Scales. Another brother, John, at the
age of twenty, was married, it is to be presumed, chiefly for interested
reasons, to the old Duchess of Norfolk, who was nearly eighty. Her
five sisters found husbands among the noblest of the Yorkist party.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

1467.</div>
</div>

<p>The displeasure of the Nevilles did not, however, at first show itself,
and Warwick stood godfather to the young Princess Elizabeth. Their
position indeed was still one of enormous influence; George, the
youngest brother, was Chancellor and Archbishop of York;
to his third brother, John of Montague, had been given the
property and title of the Percies, and he was now Earl of Northumberland;
and Warwick, Warden of the Western Marches of Scotland, and
in the receipt of public income said to amount to 80,000 crowns, was
the most popular man in the country. He lived with an ostentatious
splendour, which threw all his rivals into the background.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Nevertheless
the marriage, and the formation of the new nobility consequent
on it, began to divide England into new parties; on the one
side, such as were left of the old nobility; on the other, the new. It
was plain that the Nevilles, pledged though they were to the Yorkist
side, would sooner or later side with their order against the King
and his new friends. A still more important cause of quarrel existed
in the difference between their foreign policy and that
of the King. The House of Burgundy and Louis XI. of
France were constant rivals; and while Warwick and
the Nevilles inclined towards a French alliance, thus
deserting the old policy of the Yorkists, Edward, seeing the advantages
he would reap in a mercantile point of view, lent a willing ear to
the advances of Charles, known afterwards as Charles the Bold of
Burgundy, who was now demanding his sister Margaret as his wife.
As a contingent advantage he knew that he would find in the Burgundian
Prince a ready acknowledgment of his title to the crown of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
France, which he still had some thought of making good. On the return
of Warwick from a friendly embassy to France, he found an alliance
with Burgundy already concluded. The Count de la Roche, the natural
brother of Charles, had appeared in England on the pretext of fighting a
chivalrous duel with Anthony, Lord Scales; and had apparently arranged
the marriage between Charles and Margaret which was consummated
early in the following year. It would seem that this had been
done contrary to the will of the Nevilles; for just before the arrival of
De la Roche, at the opening of Parliament, Warwick was absent, and
the King had suddenly deprived the Archbishop of York of his chancellorship,
which he had given to the Bishop of Bath and Wells.</p>

</div>

<p>With these causes of quarrel, Warwick and the Nevilles fell back
into their old position of opposition to the Crown; and
more completely to reproduce the often-repeated state
of English politics, succeeded in securing a Plantagenet Prince as
their nominal leader. The Duke of Clarence, Edward’s brother, was
induced, in spite of the King’s prohibition, to go to Calais, and there
marry Isabella, Warwick’s daughter. This ominous union soon produced
fruits. The lower orders&mdash;those orders that are below the
burgher class&mdash;cared but little for the name of the ruler; it was
much the same to them whether Lancastrian or Yorkist was on the
throne, their interests were confined to evils which pressed upon
themselves. They were therefore ready instruments in the hands of the
opposition. And upon a quarrel upon some Church dues, the men
of the northern counties rose under a popular leader,
Robert Hilyard, commonly called Robin of Redesdale.
The insurgents soon found nobler leaders. Lords
Latimer and Fitz-Hugh, relations of Warwick, and Sir John Coniers
appeared at their head, and with 60,000 men marched southward,
declaring that Warwick alone could save the country, complaining
that the money wrung from the people was squandered upon the
Queen’s relatives, and demanding the dismissal of the new counsellors,
such as Herbert, Stafford, and Audley. At the same time,
Warwick and his brothers promised the men of Kent that they would
appear at their head to make demands similar to those of the northern
insurgents. Herbert, who had just beaten Jasper Tudor with the
last remnant of the Lancastrians in Wales, and received his title of
Earl of Pembroke, and Humphrey Stafford, who had been made Earl
of Devonshire, advanced against the rebels; but quarrelling between
themselves, they were defeated, and Pembroke beheaded, while
shortly after, Rivers and Sir John Woodville, the Queen’s father and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
brother, were captured and met the same fate. It was sufficiently
plain that Warwick had instigated this rebellion. The destruction
of his chief enemies made his power for the time paramount. He
even kept Edward for a short period prisoner in his castle of Middleham.
But his disapprobation of the Government had not yet gone so
far as to make him wish for a return of the Lancastrians. And when
that party again raised its standard in the North, he felt himself
unable to cope with it without the King’s assistance, and therefore
released him. A complete pardon was granted to the Nevilles, and
apparent harmony again reigned.</p>

<p>But it must have been obvious to all parties that it was but
a temporary truce.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Had Clarence been a man of more
ability, Warwick would probably have put him on the
throne. Failing him, it began to be plain to the Earl
that it was only by connection with the Lancastrian
party that he could hope finally to triumph over his enemies the
new nobility. A new insurrection broke out in Lincoln, against
the oppressions of the royal tax-gatherers. The insurgents, finding
themselves no better off under the new dynasty than they
had been before, declared for King Henry. At their head was
young Sir Robert Wells. The King, not yet aware of Warwick’s
designs, under promise of pardon drew Lord Wells (Sir Robert’s
father) and Sir Thomas Dymock from the sanctuary, and kept them
as hostages, and intrusted Warwick and Clarence with
the duty of collecting troops to repress the insurgents.
They collected troops, indeed, but did not suppress the insurgents;
and the King discovered that they were acting in union with Sir
Robert Wells. He at once put Dymock and Wells to death, routed
the insurgents near Empingham in Rutland, at a battle known by
the name of “Lose Coat Field,” and turned his arms against
Clarence and Warwick, who had been seeking assistance in vain from
his brother-in-law Stanley in Lancashire. They did not await his
coming, but rapidly fled through Devonshire to France. Sir Robert
Wells, anxious to revenge his father, had driven matters on too hastily
for the success of the conspiracy. Warwick had always
been anxious for a French alliance, and was therefore
well received by Louis, who felt that there was now but little chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
of peace with England except by restoration of the Lancastrians.
He therefore contrived to bring the Earl and Margaret together; and
the old enemies, finding that they had in common their hatred to
the new nobility and their views of foreign politics, agreed to forget
their old differences, and made a treaty by which Ann Neville was
to marry the Prince of Wales, upon whom the throne was settled.
Failing him it was to pass to Clarence. This treaty, which put
Clarence’s claims in the background, did not please him; and,
utterly without principle, he at once opened negotiations with his
brother, although he did not as yet openly join him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Warwick

<p>In spite of all the warnings which he received from Burgundy,
Edward remained in a condition of false security, even allowing
Montague to retain his offices in England. He was absent from
London in the North, when the Queen, Warwick and Clarence
landed in Devonshire, issued a proclamation calling on the nation to
arm, and soon found themselves surrounded by a sufficient army.
So far did Edward carry his want of suspicion, that Montague, who
at once declared for the Red Rose, as nearly as possible captured him
at dinner in the neighbourhood of Doncaster; he had
just time to escape, and fled (not without danger from a
Hanseatic fleet) to Flanders. Warwick and his friends
proceeded to London, drew the old King from the Tower, and
re-crowned him with all ceremony. A Parliament assembled on the
26th of November. All the Acts of Edward’s reign were annulled,
and a general change took place in property and offices. It marks
the effect of the fusion of parties, that this revolution, unlike most
of the events of this war, was almost bloodless. Tiptoft, Earl of
Worcester, who had rendered himself hateful by his severity as
Constable, was almost the only victim.</p>

</div>

<p>Though on many grounds (personal hatred to Warwick, sympathy
with Edward’s enmity to France, and mercantile and
family reasons) the Duke of Burgundy would have been
naturally attached to the House of York, this friendship
was of new growth, and could not make him forget his long
connection with the House of Lancaster. It was therefore with
much difficulty that Edward got from him a small pecuniary assistance.
With such as it was, however, he collected about 2000 men,
and took, what at first sight appears, the foolhardy step of landing
at Ravenspur in Yorkshire. But he knew that he had friends in his
enemy’s camp. At first, declaring, in imitation of Henry IV., that
he only came to claim his rights as Duke of York, he passed unmolested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
through Yorkshire, where Montague was. Even Warwick,
who lay in the midland counties, watched his progress unmoved.
He had received letters from Clarence, begging him not to stir till he
joined him with reinforcements. But when Clarence
took the field, it was not Warwick, but Edward to
whom he went. Strong enough now again to assume the name of
King of England, Edward marched to London, where the Archbishop
of York had tried in vain to raise enthusiasm for the Lancastrian
King. Too late, Warwick found that he had been deceived,
and he also marched towards London. Edward met
him with inferior forces in the neighbourhood of Barnet,
and there a battle was fought, in which Warwick was
entirely defeated, and himself and his brother Montague killed.
Probably the great bulk of the people cared but little who was
their ruler. York’s army was very small&mdash;less than 10,000 men. A
series of accidents gave him the victory. The indifference of the
nation, weary of the squabble, explains the rapid success of these
revolutions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the day before the battle, Queen Margaret had landed
at Weymouth. For the moment, the true Lancastrians were almost
glad when they heard that they were rid of their new
Yorkist ally. The Queen’s generals intended to march
through Wales, there make a junction with Jasper Tudor, who was
collecting forces, and thence move to their strongholds in the North.
Edward divined their plan, and pushed rapidly across England, to
secure if possible Gloucester and the valley of the Severn. The
armies encountered at Tewkesbury, where the Queen had
taken a strong position among the abbey buildings and
the neighbouring enclosures. Again the superior skill
of Edward secured the victory to his much inferior forces. The few
remaining Lancastrian nobles, the Prince of Wales, Devonshire, Lord
John Beaufort, and others, fell upon the field. The Duke of
Somerset, the fourth and last of the Beauforts, was executed after it.
Margaret and some others were taken prisoners.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edward’s

<p>There was one other danger, and then the Lancastrian party seemed
destroyed for ever. The Bastard of Falconbridge suddenly appeared
with a considerable fleet before London. The gallant defence of the
citizens, and the arrival of assistance from the King,
thwarted this last effort, and Edward returned in triumph,
having proved the stability of the house of York. His
arrival was immediately followed by the secret murder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
of King Henry, one of those dark deeds which has been attributed
without much ground to Edward’s brother, Richard of
Gloucester. A bloody court of justice held in Canterbury, for the
punishment of the Kentish men, closed this revolution of eleven
weeks. On the subsequent death of Holland, Earl of Exeter, whose
body was found upon the sea in the Straits of Dover, there were but
two important members of the Lancastrian party left. These were
Oxford, and Jasper Tudor, Earl of Pembroke, who made good their
escape to Brittany, whence Jasper’s nephew subsequently returned
to England in that expedition which terminated in Bosworth field.
The clergy and the lesser nobles, seeing further contest useless, made
their peace with the reigning house, and received pardons, and after
Parliament had re-established the Yorkist dynasty, the wars of the
Roses seemed to be at an end, and England at peace.</p>

</div>

<p>But the house of York was now to feel that ineradicable evil which
beset the Plantagenets. The princes of the family could not agree.
Clarence had already occupied the position of chief of
the opposition. He had already joined in the struggle
between the old and new nobility as the partisan of the
former party. Richard, a man of far greater ability, and of a reflective
turn of mind, was in his heart inclined in the same direction.
For the present, however, he saw his advantage in remaining the true
and very efficient assistant of his brother Edward, by whom he had
been intrusted with the government of the North. Clarence, incapable
of being a great party leader, showed his disposition in lesser
matters, and quarrelled with both his brothers. He had himself
married Warwick’s eldest daughter, Isabella, and was anxious to
appropriate all the great Warwick possessions. When Richard,
therefore, determined upon marrying Anne, the younger sister, he
hid the young lady, who is said to have been discovered by her lover
in the dress of a servant-maid, and when he was unable to prevent
the marriage, refused to divide the inheritance. A fierce quarrel was
the consequence, and it required the intervention of Parliament to
secure an equitable division of the property. Thus embroiled with
one brother, the Duke of Clarence speedily fell out with the other.
On the death of his wife in 1476, he turned his thoughts to a second
marriage with Mary of Burgundy, who became, on the
death of Charles the Bold at Nancy in 1477, the heiress
of his vast dominions. Edward prevented the marriage. In the first
place, he would have much disliked to see his brother, on whom he had
not the smallest reliance, powerful in Burgundy, and again, the Queen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
and the Queen’s party of the new nobility, were anxious that Mary
should be married to the Earl of Rivers. The breach between the
brothers was complete, and Edward, who never knew
pity, only watched for an opportunity to rid himself of
Clarence. The occasion chosen was trivial enough, but very
characteristic of that age. A gentleman of Clarence’s household,
called Burdett, had uttered some angry words against the King.
He was shortly after tried for necromancy, and as in the course of
the inquiry it appeared that, among other acts of magic, he had cast
the King’s horoscope, he was condemned to death. With this
verdict Clarence violently interfered. Edward was now able to
charge him with interfering with the course of justice. He was
impeached and tried before the House of Lords. The King in person
was his accuser, and after a hot personal quarrel, in which the King
charged him with all sorts of ungrateful acts of treason,
he was condemned to death in 1478. A petition of the
Commons, always at the command of Edward, removed the King’s
last scruple, and Clarence disappeared privately at the Tower,
drowned it is said in a butt of Malmsey wine.</p>

</div>

<p>These quarrels had occupied several years, but meanwhile matters
of more national interest had also engaged Edward’s attention.
Charles the Bold was full of vast plans for increasing his possessions,
and with the Duke of Brittany alone of the peers of France, resisted
the centralizing policy of Louis XI. He found no great
difficulty in enlisting Edward in a coalition against that
King. As early as 1472, the war had been spoken of
as probable. It did not actually take place till 1475, after a treaty
had been made by which Lorraine, Bar, and other districts lying
between Burgundy and Flanders were to be given to the Duke,
while Edward was content to stipulate for the acknowledgment of
his title as King of France, and a formal coronation at Rheims. The
war, begun on such feeble conditions, had a disgraceful conclusion.
Money, of which Edward was very fond, was scraped together, chiefly
by the personal application of the King for loans known as benevolences,
and a considerable army landed in France. But Edward did
not meet with the reception he had expected. Charles, whose mind was
incapable of carrying out the vast schemes that it planned, was engaged
in war in other parts of his dominions, and brought no
help to his ally. The gates of Péronne were shut against
him. St. Quentin, which Charles had told him would be given up
to him by the Constable of St. Pol, opened fire upon his troops.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
Provisions were scantily supplied, and Louis, who well knew the
character of his invader, saw his opportunity. At a private interview
with the herald who brought the declaration of war, he bribed
him, and won from him the hint that he might apply successfully
either to Stanley or to Howard, counsellors high in Edward’s favour.
He took the hint, found those Lords ready recipients of his bribes,
threw Amiens open, and supplied the English army lavishly with
food; and shortly persuaded Edward to arrange terms
at a personal interview at Pecquigni. He was thoroughly
afraid of the English soldiers, but rated them very low
as diplomatists, and, as his manner was when he had great objects in
view, was lavish with his money. A yearly pension, the expenses of
the war, 50,000 crowns as a ransom for Margaret, and handsome
bribes judiciously given to the chief members of the King’s Council,
secured the withdrawal of the English army. At the same time it
was arranged that the Dauphin should marry the Princess Elizabeth.
It mattered little to him, having now the English King in his pay,
that the English to cover their disgrace spoke of the money payments
as tribute, and that Edward continued to bear the title of the King
of France. Nothing can give a better view of the despicable character
of that new nobility on which Edward rested, than the readiness
with which they accepted the French King’s bribes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ambitious
projects of
marriage for
his daughters.</div>

<p>The chief objects of Edward’s life were, to collect money to be
spent in magnificent debauchery, and to secure the
position of his house by great marriages for his
daughters. He had thus arranged for the marriage
of Elizabeth, his eldest, with the Dauphin of France; Mary was to
have been married to the King of Denmark; Cicely to the eldest
son of James III. of Scotland; Katherine to the son of the King of
Castile; and Anne was destined for the son of Maximilian of
Austria, who by his marriage with Mary of Burgundy had become
the possessor of that duchy. None of these marriages took effect. The
events connected with some of them fill up the remainder of the
reign.</p>

Scotland.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Edward supports

1482.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">England obtains
Berwick.</div>
</div>

<p>James III. of Scotland was a man much like Edward, a product
of the renaissance at that time making its way in England.
Addicted to art in all its forms, he had surrounded himself
with artists, and ennobled members of the lower orders, and had
estranged all the old nobility. At the head of the discontented party
was the King’s brother, the Duke of Albany. Although James had
already received some of the dowry of the English Princess, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
consequence probably of some French intrigues, he seemed inclined
to withdraw from the engagement. Therefore, when Albany, a
fugitive from Scotland, sought his protection, Edward
determined to support him and his party, and, finally,
made a treaty with him at Fotheringay, in which he
spoke of him as King Alexander. He obtained from him a promise
of homage, and of the cession of Berwick and some other districts.
Albany also engaged to marry the Princess Cicely, who was to
be transferred to him, although previously engaged to the son of the
Scotch King. An invasion of Scotland under Richard of Gloucester,
and a conspiracy which broke out at the Bridge of Lauder, where
James’s favourite, Cochrane, was hanged, seemed for a moment to
raise Albany to the summit of his ambition. But the Scotch had no
intention of changing the succession to the throne, or suffering their
kingdom to be in any way dependent on England. They restored
Albany his property, but also returned the dowry of Cicely, and
intimated that the match was entirely broken off. The
advantage that the English gained from the whole affair
was the much disputed town of Berwick.</p>

<p>The arrangements for the marriage between Elizabeth and the
Dauphin were equally unsuccessful. Although that Princess had
assumed the name of the Dauphiness, Louis was in no hurry to
complete the marriage, and had indeed directed his views elsewhere.
In 1477, Mary of Burgundy had married Maximilian the Archduke
of Austria; and now Edward engaged to join him against France
upon condition of receiving from him the same pension as Louis had
paid him since Pecquigni. But, as usual, Louis’ diplomacy got the
better of Edward’s. Mary of Burgundy died in 1482, and the French
King contrived to make a treaty with Maximilian, by which the
Dauphin, deserting Elizabeth, engaged himself to Margaret, the
heiress of Burgundy. Edward was vowing vengeance at this trick,
and speaking of a new invasion of France, when he died on the 9th
of April, worn out probably by his self-indulgence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edward’s death.
His character.

<p>His personal beauty, his success in war, the familiarity of his
manners, his splendid household, and the share which he
allowed himself to take in the commercial enterprise of
the day, endeared Edward to the burgher class, and
rendered him on the whole a popular monarch. But beneath this
splendid exterior there existed a pitiless cruelty, a selfishness which
sought its gratification in unbounded license, and which was ready to

crossed his path. The mixture of sensuality, love of the new state
of society, mingled with political selfishness and cruelty, remind us
rather of the character of an Italian tyrant than of an English king.
The character of the monarchy which he established was also
different from that which had hitherto been seen in England. It has
been usual to name the reign of Henry VII. as that in which this
change began. It is true that that Prince and his successors
completed it; but already there are visible all the elements of that
peculiar despotic government resting upon popular favour, which is
the characteristic of the Tudor rule. In all respects Edward is the
popular King. The old nobility had for the most part been
destroyed. As around the Buonapartes of modern time, a new
nobility of relatives or personal friends of the King had begun to be
called into existence. The balance of the Constitution had been
changed by the removal of the Baronage, the great check on the
royal power, which now stood, as it were, face to face with the
Commons, who were as yet unfitted to make head against it. The
practice of tampering with the elections had ruined the independence
of Parliament. The Church, no longer in sympathy with the nation,
sought to secure their wealth by devotion to the Crown. The King
thus found no class sufficiently strong to check his prerogative. For
a time, therefore, the constitutional advance of the preceding century
was lost, and the government of England was practically despotism.
At the same time, as the disturbances caused by the Wars of the Roses
were not yet wholly over, and a short period of rapid revolutions
intervenes before the final establishment of the constitutional change
now begun, it is more convenient to adopt the old division, and to
place the epoch of the new monarchy at the Battle of Bosworth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edward’s reign
a revolution.<br /><br />
State of parties.</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Edward V. was between twelve and thirteen when he came to
the throne. His reign, which lasted from the 9th of April
to the 26th of June, was entirely occupied by a short and
not very intelligible revolution, which terminated in
the accession of his uncle, Richard of Gloucester. On the death of
Edward IV., the state of parties was rather complicated. In the
period of success which followed his restoration in 1471, he had
collected round him counsellors from all parties, although chiefly
inclined to the new nobility. His friends were thus
divided into three sections&mdash;the Queen and her family,
the most prominent members of which were Anthony, Lord Rivers;
Grey, Earl of Dorset; his brother Sir Richard Grey, and Lord Lisle,
who seem to have worked in unison with the Chancellor, Cardinal
Rotheram, Archbishop of York, and Morton, Bishop of Ely: there
were, secondly, the new nobility, of whom Hastings and Stanley
were the representatives: and, thirdly, a certain number of the
older nobles led by Stafford, Duke of Buckingham, and Sir John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
Howard. The two latter sections were full of jealousy of the
Queen’s party, in which feeling Richard joined. But his real
connection was with Buckingham and the old nobles. His first step
was, by a union of the other two parties, to overthrow the influence
of the Queen. This he immediately proceeded to do.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Richard first
overthrows
Queen’s party.</div>

<p>As the young King was being brought to London for his
coronation, under the care of Rivers and Grey, to whom
his education had been intrusted, and under whose
charge he had lived at Ludlow, Richard and Buckingham,
with 900 men, appeared upon their line of march at Northampton.
Rivers and Grey, conscious of the advantage which the
appearance of the King in London would give them, were unwilling
to come to an open quarrel, and sent Edward forward to Stony
Stratford, while they went to pay their respects to Gloucester, who
had taken the oath of allegiance, and hitherto put on all the
appearance of loyalty. The two Lords were taken prisoners at
Northampton, and Richard and Buckingham suddenly advancing to
Stratford, by the rapidity of their movements dispersed 2000 men
who accompanied Edward, and took possession of him. The news
spread dismay in London. The Queen, her son Richard and her
daughters, with Lord Lisle and the other Grey, took sanctuary at
Westminster; while Hastings calmed men’s minds by assuring them
of Richard’s loyalty, that he had only withdrawn the King
from the pernicious influence of his relations, and that he would
speedily appear with him to crown him. Upon Richard’s appearance,
therefore, everything at first went on in the regular order.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Is made
Protector.</div>

<p>According to precedent, Richard was appointed Protector
or President of the Council. With the exception
of the removal of Rotheram, and the appointment of Russell, Bishop
of Lincoln, in his place, no important changes were made, and the
Parliament was summoned, and the coronation appointed for midsummer.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Quarrels with
the new nobles.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Hastings’ death
and fall of
his party.</div>
</div>

<p>Having thus vanquished one party, Richard determined to get rid
of his other rivals also, and to rest exclusively upon
Buckingham and the old nobles. The coronation was
settled for the 22nd of June, when suddenly Richard despatched a
messenger, Sir Richard Ratcliffe, to the North, where he was much
beloved, bidding the people hasten to his aid, as the Queen was aiming
at the life of himself and Buckingham. There is no proof of any
such conspiracy. But the quarrel between the two sections of the
Council is marked by the fact that they met apart, Hastings and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
followers at St. Paul’s, Richard, Buckingham, and their friends, at
Crosby Place. They were however all joined on the 13th of June
in the Tower, when Richard suddenly appeared with angry and
suspicious countenance, charged the Queen and Jane Shore, the
King’s mistress, who now lived with Hastings, with aiming at his life
by sorcery, in proof of which he exhibited one of his arms, which was
smaller than the other, and included Hastings in the charge. At a
given signal armed men entered the chamber, and Hastings,
Stanley, and the Bishops of York and Ely, were
apprehended. Hastings was beheaded without trial on
the spot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Richard, with
Buckingham’s
help, secures
the crown.</div>

<p>This <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’état</i> was immediately followed up. The people were
summoned to the Tower, where Buckingham and Richard appeared in
rusty armour, as though in their extreme necessity they had taken it
from the armoury. Jane Shore was compelled to do penance through
the streets of London. The Queen was persuaded by the Archbishop
of Canterbury to surrender the young Prince Richard. And news
arrived that, both in the North and in Wales, the people had risen for
Richard. At the same time Grey and Rivers, hitherto kept prisoners
in Northampton, were beheaded. It only remained for Richard to
find some pretext for assuming the crown. He felt the necessity of
forestalling the coronation, which would probably have withdrawn
from him the protectorate, and have brought a commission of regency
into power. On the very day that the coronation was to have been
held, Dr. Shaw, brother of the Mayor of London, was put up to
preach at Paul’s Cross. He took for his text, “The imperfect
branches shall be broken off, their fruit unprofitable,”<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> and proceeded
to expatiate upon the lax life of the late King; and
moreover, to renew the charge which Clarence had once
made, that that King was himself illegitimate. As for
the present Princes, he asserted that they too were bastards. According
to him, before Edward’s marriage with Elizabeth Woodville, he
had been engaged to Lady Eleanor Talbot; by the laws of the
Church, therefore, his subsequent marriage was void, and the King
and his brothers illegitimate. He drew attention to the want of
resemblance between Richard of York and Edward IV., and the close
likeness which existed, on the other hand, between Richard and the
Protector. At this moment the Protector made his appearance, expecting
that the crowd would cry, “Long live, King Richard!” But the
charges were too new and surprising; he was received in perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
silence. The failure of this attempt induced him to repeat it; and
two days after, Buckingham came to Guildhall, and there addressed
the people in a similar strain. He was determined to take no refusal,
and upon a few cries of approbation, commanded the people to follow
him to Baynard’s Castle, where Richard then was. The Parliament
was just assembling, a number of Lords and representatives from the
Commons joined the crowd, and enabled him with some show of
truth to draw up a petition called “The choice and prayer of the
Lords spiritual and temporal and the Commons of England,” in
which, after recapitulating his story, he requested Richard to accept
the crown. After some show of resistance, Richard accepted the
petition, and took solemn possession of the throne at Westminster
Abbey on the 26th. That this choice was by no means unanimous
is plain from the order issued, commanding the inhabitants of London
to keep within their houses after ten o’clock, and forbidding the
wearing of arms.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Richard’s policy
of conciliation.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">His strong
position.</div>
</div>

<p>Having once secured the throne, the object of Richard seems to
have been to heal, as far as possible, the wounds
that the war had made. John Lord Howard was the
one of his followers whose reward was the most striking. His
mother having been a Mowbray, he was made Duke of Norfolk and
hereditary Marshal of England. The prisoners the King had taken,
in company with Hastings, were released, and with strange and rash
magnanimity, Stanley was given the office of Constable of England,
while Morton of Ely, an old Lancastrian, whose influence he seems to
have underrated, was sent to reside in a castle in the West of England.
He even caused the body of Henry VI. to be removed from Chertsey
Abbey to Windsor, as though the breach between the families was
healed. The King was crowned in London, and then proceeded to make
a progress through England. He had every reason to
think his position was a good one. The people everywhere
received him with a fair show of good-will. In York, where he
was a second time crowned, his reception was enthusiastic. His foreign
relations were also promising. It is true that the recognition of
France was somewhat brief and grudging; but with the young Philip
of Burgundy there was an amicable correspondence; while Queen
Isabella of Castile congratulated him heartily on having removed the
stain of his brother’s degrading marriage, and desired a close alliance
with him against France, the chief reason perhaps of her show of
affection.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Weak points
in it.</div>

<div class="sidenotex">Disaffection in
the South.</div>
</div>

<p>But, though all at first seemed so promising, Richard soon learnt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
that it was not for him to pass unopposed into the position of a
peaceful governor of a united England. The injury he
had done the memory of his late brother, the cold-heartedness
with which he had pushed aside the nephew of whom he
was the guardian, and who with his brother was kept in secret confinement
in the Tower, revived the old affection with which the South
of England had regarded Edward IV. Moreover, the Queen’s party
was not destroyed, while Richard’s own generosity had left at liberty
supporters of the old state of affairs. Consequently the whole South
of England, from Kent to Devonshire, showed signs of
an intended insurrection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of the
Princes.</div>

<p>It was just at this moment, and perhaps in the hope of removing
those around whom disaffection might centre, that the King caused
the report to be spread that the young Princes had disappeared
from the Tower. It is needless to enter into a
discussion as to their fate. The picturesque story which represents
them as smothered beneath their bedclothes is the creation of the
next age. Indeed, the popular view of the events of this reign and
of the character of Richard is derived almost wholly from Sir
Thomas More’s life of him. All that contemporary writers mention
is that the Princes disappeared, and were probably killed. Comines,
the French historian, an excellent observer, says simply that Richard
had the Princes killed in the Tower. And the fact that all those
who had the charge of them, even down to Forest, the warden, were
rewarded, makes it almost impossible that this should not have been
the case.</p>

<div class="sn-box">
<div class="sidenotex">Projected

<div class="sidenotex">Defection of

</div>

<p>The effect was not what Richard expected. The friends of his late
brother and of the Queen became still more anxious to preserve the
old stock, and, probably at the suggestion of Morton, a Lancastrian
who had found favour in Richard’s sight, the project of a marriage
between Edward’s daughter Elizabeth and the young
Richmond began to be discussed. The conspiracy soon
proved to be very widespread, and it must have been a
terrible surprise to Richard to hear that his chief friend and accomplice,
Buckingham, had declared for the house of Lancaster. That
nobleman’s motives are not clear, but he probably found that the
party of the old nobility, of which he was the leader, was no better
off under Richard than it had been under Edward. Like other
men of a tyrannical turn of mind, Richard had found his
chief support in obsequious followers, and Ratcliffe,
Catesby, and Lovel were his real advisers and friends. The Duke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
therefore, an unprincipled and very ambitious man, thought he saw
his advantage in becoming a principal agent in the restoration of
the exiled house. It is probable, also, that the influence and skill of
Morton, with whom he had been in communication, may have had
something to do with it.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Richmond’s first

<div class="sidenotex">Death of

</div>

<p>News was also brought to Richard that the young Richmond, who
after Tewkesbury had fled with his uncle to Brittany, and had there
become the centre of the Lancastrian party, was meditating
a descent on England. Richard displayed his
usual energy. He called on the men of York, on whom he could
rely, to meet him at Leicester; hastily wrote to the Archbishop of
York to send him the Great Seal, an unconstitutional act which
Russell did not resist; put a price on the head of Buckingham; and
appointed, as though sure of victory, a vice-constable to superintend
any summary executions that might be necessary. Meanwhile, Kent,
Surrey, Berkshire, Wiltshire, and Devon had risen, and Grey, Lord
Dorset, had declared for Henry Tudor in Exeter. It was the intention
of Buckingham, who was in Wales, to form a junction with the
Southern leaders. For this purpose it was necessary to cross the
Severn. But Sir Humphrey Stafford had broken the bridges, the
floods were out, and the river impassable. His Welsh
followers deserted, and Buckingham was obliged to
fly. He sought a refuge with a dependant of his own in
Shropshire, of the name of Banister, by whom he was betrayed.
After vain entreaties for a personal interview with Richard, and for a
legal trial, he was summarily executed. Richmond’s part of the
conspiracy had been an equal failure. His fleet had been scattered
by a storm. He himself reached Plymouth, but the news of the
failure of Buckingham, and the appearance of the King in the South,
before whose approach all the gatherings of the rebels dissolved,
induced him to return to Brittany.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament
and great
confiscation.
1484.</div>

<p>Again undisputed master of England, Richard summoned a Parliament
to meet him in January. As was usual when
one party was predominant, it proved to be devoted to
the Government. Richard’s special favourite, Catesby,
was chosen for speaker, and all Richard’s claims to the throne were
declared to be just. Nor was this all: the oath of allegiance was
demanded from all the adult population of England; and a huge
bill of attainder and confiscation, mentioning more than 500 names,
was passed. As the King was allowed to regrant the confiscated
property, he was enabled to fill the southern counties with northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
proprietors devoted to his cause; while with questionable wisdom, as
it afterwards appeared, he sought to purchase the fidelity of the
Stanleys, by giving to Lord Stanley, her present husband, the property
of the Countess Margaret of Richmond, who was included in the bill
of attainder.</p>

<p>But though defeated in his first efforts, her son, Henry Tudor, continued
his preparations abroad. It was in vain that Richard, by
promising Francis of Brittany his assistance against
France, and by bribing the all-powerful minister Pierre
Landais, succeeded in procuring Henry’s dismissal from
Brittany. He fled to the Court of Charles VIII. of France, where he
was well received, and where the Lancastrian exiles gathered round
him. Richard felt that all his efforts were necessary to oppose this
Prince. He collected troops, demanded ships from the
Cinque Ports, attempted a reconciliation with the Queen
Dowager, by allowing her with her daughters to leave the sanctuary
at Westminster, and contemplated a marriage between
his own son Edward and her eldest daughter Elizabeth,
a marriage which would have been the death blow to the Lancastrian
party. He succeeded moreover in procuring a three years’ truce with
Scotland, and the promise of a marriage between the Duke of
Rothesay, the heir to the Scotch crown, and his niece.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The most
important part of his plan was frustrated by the untimely
death of his son, which plunged him in the
deepest grief. But he strove to supply his place by
nominating his nephew John de la Pole, the Earl of Lincoln, his heir.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">General

<div class="sidenotex">His recourse to
benevolences.</div>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile the feeling of uneasiness increased. Lancastrian
emissaries moved to and fro through the country. Clifford and some
others of them were apprehended and put to death. But the evil
was too great to admit of a speedy remedy. Libels were freely
scattered through the country; among others the well-known
couplet, “The rat, the cat, and Lovel the dog,
rule all England under the Hog,” a plain allusion to
his chief friends, Ratcliffe, Catesby and Lovel. William Collingbourne,
its author, was captured and put to death. But libels increased
in number, especially when there seemed to be grounds for
asserting that, though his wife was still living, he was himself thinking
of a subsequent marriage with the Princess Elizabeth of York.
The opportune illness and death of his wife, and, it may be, the
love<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> felt for him by the Princess, added such an air of truth to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
the story, that, at the instigation of his best friends, he was induced
to make a public contradiction of it before the Common Council in
London. His finances, too, were in disorder. Free-handed
and ostentatious, he had speedily spent the
wealth which his brother’s avarice had accumulated; and though he
had himself caused a bill to be passed to put an end to benevolences,
he was reduced to have recourse to that illegal method of taxation
which the people in bitter jest termed the raising of malevolences.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Battle of

</div>

<p>He was however prepared, when Richmond, supported by the
French, made his second attempt upon England. But
unfortunately for Richard, treason was at work among
his own followers, and the Stanleys, without principle, without
gratitude, and with a constant eye to their own aggrandizement, were
in secret alliance with their young kinsman the Lancastrian Prince.
At length the invasion came. The place of landing, which had been
kept a profound secret, was Milford Haven: for the Tudor thought
it prudent to enlist the national prejudices of the Welsh in his favour.
The Leopard of England and the Dragon of Wales floated side by
the side on his standards. He advanced in safety to Shropshire;
and the Welsh leaders joined him, as well as the
Talbots of Shrewsbury. Richard had assembled his forces in the
centre of England. Northumberland brought him troops from the
North, Howard from the South, Brackenbury from London, Norfolk
from the East. But it was very doubtful what part the Stanleys
would take; and it was through the county where they were powerful,
both as proprietors and as the King’s governors, that Richmond
had to pass. Lord Stanley demanded leave to go to his county;
but the King, whose suspicions had been raised, insisted on his
leaving his son Lord Strange as a hostage. Pleading illness, Lord
Stanley had refused to join Richard, and with 5000 men retired
before the invader, whom his brother Sir William had
now openly joined. In August the armies approached
one another in the neighbourhood of Atherstone.
Richard then threw aside all doubts. He ordered Lord Strange
to be beheaded, and felt that the struggle must be a final one. Lord
Strange’s keepers, however, thought it well to await the issue of the
battle before carrying out the command: and in the middle of the
struggle, Lord Stanley, who, afraid for his son’s life, had kept aloof
with his troops, suddenly joined Richmond. This turned the
fortunes of the day; and in spite of the greatest personal bravery,
Richard’s army was completely beaten, and himself killed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Richard’s
character and
laws.</div>

<p>His character has been the subject of much discussion, nor is this
strange. Had he lived in times of greater security, he
would have been an able and admirable governor.
Several of the enactments of his reign attest his wisdom
and his love of justice. He recognized the evil of benevolences, and
forbad them, although necessity drove him to have recourse to them.
His efforts were much directed to the re-establishment of justice, to
support which he had caused a bill to be passed, to secure the respectability
of jurymen, by forbidding any but freeholders to the amount of
40s. from serving in that capacity. He restrained the lawlessness of the
barons by the suppression of liveries; and while promising to uphold
the liberties of the Church, had shown that he would not allow any
interference with the civil power. He had also fostered the trade of
England by opening fresh markets for English wool both in Spain and
in Iceland. His personal character, too, was attractive. With beautiful
though peculiar features, he was liberal and at times forgiving to
the verge of folly. He had pardoned and extended constant favour to
the wives and families of his political victims. In spite of his strange
charge of adultery against her, he had been always a dutiful and
affectionate son to his mother. The gentle side of his disposition is
perhaps shown by his passionate love of music. But the troublous
times in which he lived called out all his worst characteristics; and
for political ends he had shown himself scheming, cold, and cruel;
while the tyrannical temperament, which could brook no opposition,
hurried him into deeds of violence which were the proximate cause
of his downfall.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">Political
condition of
the nation.</div>

<p>It is necessary, as the border-land is thus reached between modern
civilization and that of the middle ages, to say a few
words on the political condition of the nation, which
allowed of the establishment of the personal monarchy
of the Tudors, and of the social state of the people from
which modern forms of civilization were to spring.</p>

<p>During the earlier part of the Lancastrian rule, Parliament, and
especially the House of Commons, had apparently continued to rise
in power. The Constitutional growth of the fourteenth century had
been continued. The Commons had secured the unquestioned right
of originating money bills, not to be altered by the House of Lords,
nor discussed in the presence of the King. They had secured the
right not only of recommending in petitions, but also of joining
as an equal estate of the realm in the passing of laws. They had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
succeeded during the reign of Henry VI. in preventing any changes
in the form of their petitions (which had not unfrequently been
introduced when, after the session, the petition was enrolled), by
bringing in complete Statutes, called Bills, to be rejected or accepted
as a whole, instead of their old petitions. They had, in several
instances, practised unquestioned the right of impeachment, and
claimed, with some degree of success, the freedom of their members
from arrest, even during the recess of Parliament. But in spite
of this apparent advance, the real power of the Parliament before
the close of the Wars of the Roses had almost disappeared. A
statute in the eighth year of Henry VI. limited the franchise, with
regard to the election of knights of the shire, to freeholders of lands
or tenements to the value of forty shillings. This at once gave an
aristocratic tone to the House. In addition to this it had become
the fashion both of the nobility and of the Crown to tamper with
the elections. With the new restricted franchise, the power of local
magnates in the county elections was predominant, while, as regards
the boroughs, the sheriffs exercised a power of summoning burgesses
from such towns only as they pleased, and it was not difficult for the
Crown or ruling party to bring the sheriffs under their influence.
While the House of Commons thus lost its independence, the old
Upper House had been virtually destroyed, and the new nobility was
by its very nature dependent on the Crown. Another most important
element of freedom had likewise disappeared. The great
Churchmen, to whom the liberties of England owe so much, had
been victorious over their enemies the Lollards. In the struggle
they had lost their sympathy with the people. Their desire for the
spiritual welfare of the country had shrivelled to a selfish eagerness
for the preservation of orthodoxy. They had been drawn into
closer communication with Rome, and had begun to share its
interests. Cardinal Beaufort, in spite of all opposition, had
succeeded in retaining his Roman rank, and it had become habitual
that the Archbishop of Canterbury at least should bear the title
of Cardinal. Wealthy, worldly and self-seeking, the leaders of
the clergy were inclined to devote themselves to political life; and,
conscious of the alienation of the lower orders, and fearing for their
property, which had already excited the envy of the laity, and which,
while confiscation was reducing the nobles to beggary, had remained
almost untouched, they sought employment and safety in becoming
the devoted servants of the King.</p>

<p>At the same time that the practical efficiency of the Parliament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
had been decreasing, the power of the King’s Council had been on
the increase. The limits of its rights, springing as it did from the
Concilium Ordinarium of the Plantagenet kings, had always been
questionable, and its encroachments, in meddling with the petitions
of the Lower House, and in issuing ordinances without the consent of
Parliament, which had yet the authority of temporary laws, had
been constantly objected to by the Commons. The long minority of
Henry VI., during which the chief direction of the Government had
been almost unavoidably in the hands of the Council, had tended
greatly to increase its power.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of the
Wars of the
Roses.</div>

<p>Nevertheless, though constitutional growth had been checked, and
the Commons had politically lost ground, the Wars of
the Roses did not produce that complete exhaustion
and depopulation of the country which might have
been expected. The population appears to have been little, if at all,
decreased, the number of inhabitants was still between three and
four millions. In fact, it must be remembered that the broken
hostilities of these wars did not on the whole amount to much more
than three years of actual warfare; that the armies were in the field
only for short consecutive periods, were usually few in number, and
composed of untrained men, who returned, immediately their short
service was over, to the cultivation of the fields. Thus the destruction
and turbulence seemed to pass over the head of the great bulk
of the population. Nor is this all. During the whole continuance
of the war, the ordinary apparatus of justice was uninterrupted; courts
were held, and judges went their circuit as usual. Indeed, it would
seem to have been a period of unusual litigation, attended no doubt
often with violence. For as property rapidly changed hands the
titles to it became insecure, and the process therefore by which a
title was questioned was frequently the violent dispossession of the
present holder. But still it was to the courts of law that the
ultimate appeal was made. Again, although the loss of France and
the exclusive attention to home politics greatly diminished the
national strength upon the sea, trade does not appear to have been
seriously damaged. At all events, it was so kept alive, that upon the
establishment of peace it revived with fresh vigour; and we are
told that Edward IV. himself engaged in the pursuit. This trait is
characteristic not only of the man but of the time. The pursuit of
trade had risen greatly in estimation; great traders had become
nobles, and Suffolk, the prime minister, was an example of the
height to which such families might rise. From the decay of noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
families, and other more permanent causes, land had been necessarily
brought into the market. Wealthy traders had purchased it, set up
for landowners, and aimed at the dignity of knighthood. At the
same time, the secondary gentry of the country, taking advantage of
the decline of the nobility, found means in the midst of the disturbances
to increase their property and influence. In spite therefore
of the apparent insignificance of Parliament, the middle classes
were in a vigorous and improving condition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Changes in the
lower classes.</div>

<p>Lower down in the social scale the case was somewhat different.
Serfdom had indeed almost disappeared, and existed
only here and there in isolated cases. Free labour for
wages had become general, and land was largely held by payment of
money rents. Thus far there was improvement. But the change
from slavery to personal freedom is always purchased at a somewhat
heavy price&mdash;that price is the existence of poverty; it is no longer
incumbent on employers to look after the wellbeing of free labourers;
in time of want they are thrown upon their own resources. The
new possessors of the soil too were inclined to work it to better
profit than their predecessors had done; grazing became more
common and employment proportionately scarcer. The unemployed
labourer had two courses open to him: he might betake himself to
the towns, or join the ranks of the rapidly increasing class of beggars.
He there found himself in company of numbers of idle and needy
men who took advantage of the disturbed state of the country.
Discharged soldiers and sailors, and vagabonds who called themselves
travelling scholars, were so plentiful, that as there was as yet no
poor law in existence, stringent enactments were made against them.
The number of those punished for crimes of lawlessness and violence
was enormous. Fortescue describes with pride how the poor Englishman,
seeing others possess what he wanted, would never scruple to
take it by violence rather than be without it. Those of the unemployed
labourers who preferred to seek the towns went to increase
the crowd of journeymen, whose position could not have been very
enviable. For the guild system was breaking down and giving
place to the more modern arrangements of unlimited competition.
The craft guilds, which in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries
had triumphed over the merchant guilds and aristocratic citizens of
the towns, had speedily begun to deteriorate. The object for which
they were founded was to secure for all members of the craft a fair
chance of livelihood, without the danger of destructive competition.
This object implied that the guild was co-extensive with the trade,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
and that its members were themselves craftsmen, carrying on their
work with their own hands, with the assistance of apprentices. But
a crowd of enfranchised villeins and unemployed labourers had
gathered in the towns, and formed a class of journeymen or day-labourers,
and the guild, originally a corporation of working men,
changed gradually into an exclusive body of capitalists. Moreover,
even within their own limits, their principles had failed as early as
the reign of Edward III. We hear, for instance, of certain pepperers,
who, separating themselves from their guild, became grocers [grossers]
or general dealers. In other words, as individuals accumulated capital,
they refused to have their enterprise limited by the guild laws;
and thus setting up as independent capitalists, began to introduce
the same relations between employer and employed which exist at
present. Under these circumstances the unincorporated journeymen
found the restrictions of the guild an obstacle in the way of advance,
and were exposed to all the evils of an eager competition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Influence of the
Renaissance.</div>

<p>While thus the political position of the different orders was giving
room for a temporary establishment of almost absolute
monarchy, but at the same time allowing the formation
of that middle class which was to overthrow it, and while the
exclusive system of the middle ages was giving way to the modern
relations of labour, the new culture, the existence of which more
than anything else separates the middle ages from modern times,
was beginning to make its way. As the leader in this direction
Humphrey of Gloucester may be mentioned. In spite of his
turbulent and disorderly character, he was a sincere lover of literature.
He was in communication with several of the greater Italian scholars.
More than one classical translation was dedicated to him. He
carried his love of inquiry so far that he is believed to have dabbled
in magical arts; and it is generally reported that his books, which he
left to Oxford, were the nucleus of the present great library there.
He did not stand alone in his literary tastes. Tiptoft the Earl of
Worcester was likewise impregnated with Italian learning, and,
among the newer nobles, Lord Rivers gave distinguished patronage
to the art of printing, which Caxton introduced into England in the
year 1469. Altogether, it would seem that among the upper classes
the rudiments of learning were beginning to be widely spread, and
that the laity were gradually becoming sufficiently cultivated to rival
the Churchmen, and to take their proper part in the government of
the country. It may be observed as an indication of this that Henry
VI.’s reign was marked by the foundation of Eton, and that several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
considerable colleges were founded both in Oxford and Cambridge
during the century. It is probable that these were chiefly intended
as defences for orthodoxy, the teaching being as yet confined to the
worst form of scholasticism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Change in the
military system.</div>

<p>It is strange, immediately after the great civil war, and before the
outbreak of nautical energy under the reign of Queen
Elizabeth, to meet with constant complaints of the
degeneracy of the English as soldiers. But it seems as if changes in
the military system, and the love of money and luxury which
accompanied the Renaissance, were really producing their effects.
Archery was giving way to the use of gunpowder; and we meet
with statutes fixing the price of bows, and enacting general practice
of archery, which clearly show that the use of the national weapon
had to be artificially fostered. There was considerable difficulty in
collecting a sufficiency of troops before the Battle of Bosworth, and
Caxton writes to Richard III. a deplorable account of the decay of
knighthood, to be cured, as he thinks, by the reintroduction of
tournaments and the perusal of chivalrous romances. A change in
warfare was, in fact, going on in Europe, which called into existence
abroad standing armies, and the effect of which was felt in England,
though circumstances postponed the establishment of a regular army
some time longer. It was thus amid the general weakness in all
classes except the Crown, and during the development of great
social changes, that the Tudor sovereigns found it possible to establish
that peculiar personal monarchy which occupies the transition period
between mediæval and modern times, and under the shadow of
which the various classes regained strength for the subsequent
re-establishment of the Constitution.</p>

knights’ fees of England were popularly put at 60,000: at the same rate this would
have amounted to £180,000. The scutage in England was, however, only two marks
on a knight’s fee. The scutage was repeated two years afterwards. On the supposition
that the sum mentioned applies to both those scutages, there would have been a
payment of four marks, or £2, 13s. 4d., on a knight’s fee. This would give £160,000.

a Tuscan Canonist, produced a collection of Papal decisions, known by his name, in
1151. The Decretals are collections of letters written by the early Popes in answers to
questions addressed to them by the Bishops. The first collection was made at Rome
by Dionysius in 550. In this collection, letters exaggerating Papal authority were subsequently
introduced, known as the False Decretals. They received the Papal sanction
from Nicholas I. about 860.</p></div>

year 1354. The total value of the exports was £212,338. They consisted of 31,651
sacks of wool, at £6 a sack; 65 wool-fells, hides, to the value of £89; 4774 pieces of
cloth; 8061 pieces of worsted stuff. The imports mentioned consist of a little fine cloth
and wax; 1830 tuns of wine; and linens, mercery, and grocery to the value of £23,000.
To show the severity of the wool tax, it is to be observed that on the above-named exports
the duty was £81,846, or more than 40 per cent. Robert of Avesbury gives a
somewhat different account. He put the exports at 100,000 sacks of wool. He is

palatine, confederacies were formed, who made sudden irruptions into the neighbouring
counties, and carried off young women, particularly heiresses. They then retired
within the freedoms of the counties palatine, and held their captives to ransom. The
bodies of retainers who gathered round individual nobles, and stood by one another in
such illegal actions as forcible desiesin, or ejection of rightful owners from their property,
also received the name.</p></div>

<p class="pfs150"><em>HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHIES</em></p>

<p class="p1 pfs80"><em>Edited by</em></p>

<p class="pfs100">THE REV. M. CREIGHTON, M.A.,</p>

<p class="p1 pfs60">LATE FELLOW AND TUTOR OF MERTON COLLEGE, OXFORD.</p>

<p class="p1 pfs80"><em>With Maps and Plans. Small 8vo.</em></p>


<div class="p1 fs80">
<p>The most important and the most difficult point in Historical
Teaching is to awaken a real interest in the minds of Beginners.
For this purpose concise handbooks are seldom useful. General
sketches, however accurate in their outlines of political or constitutional
development, and however well adapted to dispel false ideas,
still do not make history a living thing to the <em>young</em>. They are
most valuable as maps on which to trace the route beforehand and
show its direction, but they will seldom allure any one to take a
walk.</p>

<p>The object of this series of Historical Biographies is to try and
select from English History a few men whose lives were lived in
stirring times. The intention is to treat their lives and times in
some little detail, and to group round them the most distinctive
features of the periods before and after those in which they lived.</p>

<p>It is hoped that in this way interest may be awakened without
any sacrifice of accuracy, and that personal sympathies may be
kindled without forgetfulness of the principles involved.</p>

<p>It may be added that round the lives of individuals it will be
possible to bring together facts of social life in a clearer way, and
to reproduce a more vivid picture of particular times than is possible
in a historical handbook.</p>

<p>By reading short Biographies a few clear ideas may be formed in
the pupil’s mind, which may stimulate to further reading. A vivid
impression of one period, however short, will carry the pupil onward
and give more general histories an interest in their turn. Something,
at least, will be gained if the pupil realizes that men in past
times lived and moved in the same sort of way as they do at present.</p>
